This code defines several JavaScript functions used throughout the PhpMyAdmin interface. Here are some of the key ones:

* `PMA_checkPageValidity()`: This function checks whether the user is allowed to access a specific page. It returns `true` if the user has permission, and `false` otherwise. The function takes two arguments: the first is an integer representing the maximum number of variables that can be passed in the URL (usually set in the `max_input_vars` setting in your PHP configuration), and the second is a boolean indicating whether or not to check for SSL encryption (usually set in the `https` setting in your PhpMyAdmin configuration).
* `PMA_ignorePhpErrors(clearPrevErrors)`: This function ignores displayed PHP errors. It removes the displayed errors from the page and optionally clears any stored errors from the server session using an AJAX request.
* `isStorageSupported(type)`: This function checks whether a specific type of web storage (such as local or session storage) is supported by the browser. It returns `true` if it is, and `false` otherwise. The function takes one argument: the type of storage to check for.

The code also defines several event handlers using the `AJAX.registerOnload()` and `AJAX.registerTeardown()` functions. These allow PhpMyAdmin to handle events such as form submits, changes in radio buttons, and page loads.
