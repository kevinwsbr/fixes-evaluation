**Functionality:**

The code snippet you provided implements a JavaScript interface for a chart-creation tool. It handles various user interactions, such as:

- Selecting chart options (line, stack series, etc.)
- Changing chart title
- Selecting x-axis and value columns
- Adjusting chart labels
- Submitting an AJAX form to retrieve chart data

**Key Features:**

- User interface elements for configuration options
- Event handlers for user interactions
- Data validation and error handling
- Chart drawing function
- AJAX request for data retrieval

**Code Breakdown:**

- **Event Handlers:** The code attaches event handlers to various elements, such as checkboxes, input fields, and select options. These handlers update the `currentSettings` object based on user selections and trigger chart redrawing.
- **`currentSettings` Object:** This object stores the current configuration settings for the chart, including chart type, title, axis labels, data columns, and stack series option.
- **Data Retrieval:** The code submits an AJAX request to a server-side script to retrieve chart data based on the selected options.
- **Chart Drawing:** The `drawChart()` function is responsible for generating the chart based on the `currentSettings` and retrieved data.
- **Validation:** The code includes a function `checkSqlQuery()` to validate the SQL query entered in the form.

**Additional Notes:**

- The code uses the jQuery library for DOM manipulation and event handling.
- The `codemirror_editor` variable is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code.
- The `chart_data` variable is used to store the retrieved chart data.
- The `getSelectedSeries()` function is not shown in the code snippet.

**Conclusion:**

The JavaScript code snippet provides a comprehensive framework for creating and configuring a chart-creation tool. It handles user interactions, data retrieval, and chart drawing, allowing users to customize and display charts based on their input.
