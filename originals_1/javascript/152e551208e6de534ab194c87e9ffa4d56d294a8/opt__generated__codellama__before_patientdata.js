This code defines an object named `page` that contains functions for the Patient Detail dialog in the HealthStream application. The `page` object is used to manage the state of the dialog and to interact with the model (the Patient object) being displayed in the dialog.

The `openDialog` function is called when the user clicks on a Patient record in the list view or in the patient portal. It sets the state of the dialog, fetches the appropriate data for the Patient object from the server, and displays the dialog.

The `closeDialog` function is called when the user closes the dialog without saving any changes. It simply hides the dialog.

The `saveModel` function is called when the user clicks on the "Save" button in the dialog. It saves the changes made to the Patient object and re-fetches and renders the collection of Patients after the model has been updated (if necessary).

The `deleteModel` function is called when the user clicks on the "Delete" button in the dialog. It deletes the Patient record from the server and re-fetches and renders the collection of Patients after the model has been deleted (if necessary).
