This code snippet is from the TensorFlow library and it is related to the implementation of max pooling operations. Here's a breakdown of the code:

**1. Forward declarations:**

- The code declares forward declarations for GPU-specific max pooling functor specializations.
- Each specialization handles a different data type (float, double, etc.).

**2. Kernel registration:**

- It registers GPU-specific max pooling kernels for different data types.
- It also registers kernels specifically for GPU but only implemented for that device.
- These kernels are faster than the default Eigen implementations.

**3. Kernel labels:**

- The code uses labels like "eigen_tensor" to specify the kernel using the Eigen implementation.
- This allows users to explicitly choose the Eigen version if they need it.

**4. Data types:**

- The code supports various data types, including floats, doubles, and quantized types.

**Overall, this code sets up GPU-specific max pooling kernels that are optimized for performance.**

**Note:**

- The code may require additional dependencies or configurations depending on the specific TensorFlow version and platform.
- The commented-out code section may be active in certain versions of TensorFlow.
