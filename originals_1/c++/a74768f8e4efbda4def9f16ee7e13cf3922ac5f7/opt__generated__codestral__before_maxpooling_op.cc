 This is a file containing the registration of various GPU kernels for Max Pooling operations in TensorFlow. These kernels are specific to the GPU device and provide implementations for different data types such as float, double, int32, etc. The kernels are registered using macros which define the kernel name, device type (GPU), data type, and host memory requirements.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The file includes necessary TensorFlow headers and defines the namespace as `tensorflow`.

2. It then defines some macros that will be used to register different versions of Max Pooling kernels.

3. For various data types, it registers GPU kernels for Max Pooling operations using the `REGISTER_MAX_POOL_KERNELS` macro. This macro expands to a series of kernel registrations based on the device type (GPU), data type, and kernel name. The registered kernels include both forward and backward propagation versions.

4. Additionally, for GPU devices only, it registers specific Max Pooling kernels that are not available for CPU devices using the `REGISTER_GPU_ONLY_POOL_KERNELS` macro. These kernels include variants of Max Pooling with custom gradients and other specialized operations.

5. Finally, the file undefines the macros used for kernel registration to prevent any potential conflicts or issues in other parts of TensorFlow codebase.
