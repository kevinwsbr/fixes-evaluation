**Module Initialization and Device Driver**

The provided code snippet describes a Linux module driver for a FarSync WAN device (FST). The driver is written in C and uses the PCI device model.

**Key Functionality:**

* **Driver Initialization:**
    * Allocates an array of `fst_card_info` structures to represent up to `FST_MAX_CARDS` cards.
    * Initializes a spin lock for synchronizing access to shared data structures.
* **Device Probe:**
    * Detects and initializes a new FST card upon insertion.
    * Resets the card and initializes its DMA buffers if necessary.
    * Sets up the card's interrupt handler and registers it with the kernel.
* **Device Removal:**
    * Disables interrupts and releases resources associated with the card.
    * Unregisters the card's net devices and frees DMA buffers.
* **Module Initialization:**
    * Registers the driver with the PCI subsystem.
* **Module Exit:**
    * Unregisters the driver and logs a message upon module removal.

**Device Configuration:**

* The driver supports multiple cards based on the `FST_MAX_CARDS` constant.
* Each card has a unique `card_no` to identify it in the array.
* The driver allocates DMA buffers for transmit and receive operations on TXU cards.

**Key Functions:**

* `fst_add_one()`: Probed when a new FST card is detected.
* `fst_remove_one()`: Called when a card is removed.
* `fst_init()`: Initializes the module.
* `fst_cleanup_module()`: Cleans up the module upon exit.

**Module Features:**

* Supports multiple FST cards.
* Initializes and configures each card.
* Handles interrupts and data transfers.
* Provides an interface for network devices to communicate with the FST card.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code uses various functions and data structures related to PCI device drivers, net devices, and interrupts.
* The specific hardware and functionality of the FST device are not explicitly described in this snippet.
