This function takes a `struct sip_msg` object and two regular expression objects as input, and performs the following operations:

1. It searches for an SDP session in the message using the first regular expression object (`re`). If no such session is found, it returns -1.
2. Once a session is found, it searches for a stream within that session that matches the second regular expression object (`re2`). If no matching stream is found, it returns -1.
3. If a matching stream is found, it deletes it from the message using the `del_lump` function.
4. It then marks the deleted lump as empty in the associated SDP cell of the message.
5. Finally, it returns 1 to indicate that a stream was successfully deleted.

Note that the function uses two regular expression objects instead of just one because the `stream_find` and `stream_delete` functions need to be able to search for different types of streams based on different criteria. The first regular expression object (`re`) is used to find the session, while the second regular expression object (`re2`) is used to find the specific stream within that session.

The function also uses a few other helper functions to perform its operations, including `get_sdp`, `get_body`, and `del_lump`. These functions are not shown in the code snippet provided.
