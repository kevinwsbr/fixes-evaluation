 This is a code snippet for defining CPU models and their related operations in the LoongArch CPU class for an emulator. The snippet defines a base LoongArchCPUClass, which has several methods such as get_phys_page_debug, realizefn, reset, dump_state, set_pc, gdb_read_register, gdb_write_register, disas_set_info, and tcg_ops. The snippet also defines a specific CPU model "la464" which inherits from the base LoongArchCPUClass. The code uses macros to define the CPU type and its initialization function. Additionally, it provides functions for querying available CPU definitions using QMP (QEMU Machine Protocol).
