**Image Encoding Using TIFF**

The provided code snippet describes the process of encoding images using the TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) format. The code includes the following key functionalities:

**1. Memory Allocation:**
- Allocates memory for colormap arrays (red, green, blue) for colormapped TIFF images.
- Ensures memory allocation success before proceeding.

**2. Colormap Initialization:**
- Initializes the colormap arrays with grayscale values for each color.
- Scales the RGB values of each color in the image's colormap to 16-bit integers.
- Sets the TIFF colormap field using the initialized arrays.

**3. Grayscale Image Encoding:**
- Converts pseudo-class packets to contiguous grayscale scanlines.
- Sets the quantum type and writes the image data to the TIFF file.

**4. TIFF File Configuration:**
- Creates TIFF image information, including width, height, and photometric mode.
- Sets the TIFF directory and prints the directory for debugging purposes.

**5. Image Progress Tracking:**
- Updates image progress during encoding.

**6. Error Handling:**
- Throws an exception if memory allocation fails.
- Stops encoding if any TIFF write operation fails.

**7. Adjoining Image Handling:**
- Encodes multiple images into a single TIFF file if specified.

**Purpose:**

The purpose of this code is to efficiently encode images into the TIFF format, taking into account colormaps, alpha channels, and image progress tracking.

**Key Points:**

- TIFF is a widely used image format for storing lossless and lossy compressed images.
- Colormapped TIFFs are suitable for images with a limited number of colors.
- Grayscale TIFFs are used for images with a single color channel.
- The code handles both colormapped and grayscale TIFF image encoding.
- Progress tracking ensures that the user is informed about the encoding progress.

**Additional Notes:**

- The code assumes that the necessary TIFF library is available.
- The TIFF image compression options can be customized as needed.
- The image encoding process can be extended to support additional image formats.
