 This is a kernel module that provides a way for user-space applications to access hardware performance counters. It includes code related to memory mapping of the performance counter data, as well as initialization and cleanup of the system.

The module defines several functions:

* `perf_event_sysfs_init`: This function is called during kernel initialization to register the performance event subsystem with the kernel. It creates a new bus for performance events and allocates resources for each performance counter.
* `__perf_cgroup_move`: This function is called when a task moves between cgroups, and is responsible for switching the task's performance counters between the two cgroups.
* `perf_cgroup_attach`: This function is called when a new task is added to a cgroup, and is responsible for attaching the task's performance counters to the cgroup.
* `perf_cgroup_exit`: This function is called when a task exits, and is responsible for switching the task's performance counters back to the root cgroup before the task is freed.

The module also includes code related to cgroup performance events, which allow user-space applications to control which performance events are available in each cgroup.

Overall, this module provides a way for user-space applications to access hardware performance counters and gain insight into the performance of their system.
