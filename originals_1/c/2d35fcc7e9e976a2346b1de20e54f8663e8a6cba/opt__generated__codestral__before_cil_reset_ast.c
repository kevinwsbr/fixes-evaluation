 This is a function in C that resets the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) nodes based on their type. It takes a pointer to the current node in the tree as an argument and traverses the tree using `cil_tree_walk()` function, which applies a given callback function to each node in the tree until it reaches NULL.

The callback function used here is `__cil_reset_node()`, which determines the type of the current node and calls the appropriate reset function based on that type. The types are defined as macros such as CIL_SENSITIVITY, CIL_CATSET, etc. Each macro corresponds to a specific function to reset the node's data, e.g., `cil_reset_sensitivity()`, `cil_reset_catset()`, etc.

The function returns SEPOL_OK if it successfully resets all nodes in the AST; otherwise, it returns SEPOL_ERR and logs an error message.
