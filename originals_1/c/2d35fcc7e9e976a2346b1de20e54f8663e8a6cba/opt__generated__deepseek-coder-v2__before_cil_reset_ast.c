 The provided code snippet is a function in the C programming language that resets various types of nodes in a Common Information Model (CIM) Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This function, `cil_reset_ast`, iterates over each node in the AST and calls specific reset functions based on the type of the node. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `cil_reset_ast` takes a pointer to a `struct cil_tree_node` as its parameter, which represents the root of the AST that needs to be reset.

2. **Return Type and Setup**: The function returns an integer (`int`), where success is indicated by `SEPOL_OK` (0) and failure by `SEPOL_ERR` (-1). It initializes a return code variable `rc` with `SEPOL_ERR`.

3. **Walking the AST**: The function uses `cil_tree_walk` to traverse each node in the AST. The traversal callback (`__cil_reset_node`) is defined elsewhere and takes care of calling the appropriate reset function based on the type of the node being visited.

4. **Error Handling**: If `cil_tree_walk` returns a non-zero value (indicating failure), the function logs an error message using `cil_log` and returns `SEPOL_ERR`.

5. **Node Type Switches**: Inside the callback of `cil_tree_walk`, there is a switch statement (`switch(node->type)`) that handles different node types:
   - Each case corresponds to a specific type of node, such as `CIL_AVRULE`, `CIL_SENS`, etc.
   - For each valid node type, the corresponding reset function (e.g., `cil_reset_avrule`, `cil_reset_sens`) is called with `node->data` as its argument.
   - If the node type does not match any of the handled types (`default:`), nothing is done for that particular node.

6. **Return Value**: Regardless of whether the function succeeds or fails, it always returns either `SEPOL_OK` (0) or `SEPOL_ERR` (-1).

This code snippet effectively demonstrates how to iterate over a complex data structure and perform actions based on its components in a structured manner, using function pointers and switch statements for dispatching the appropriate operations.
