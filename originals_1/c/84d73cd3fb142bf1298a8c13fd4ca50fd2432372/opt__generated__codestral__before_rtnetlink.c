 This is a section of kernel code for the rtnetlink subsystem, which is used to communicate with userspace programs for network configuration tasks. The code initializes various data structures and registers different types of events that can occur in the system. Here's a breakdown:

1. `rtnetlink_event` is a callback function that gets triggered whenever there's a change in a network device. Depending on the type of event (such as a new link being added, a link going down, or a default case), it calls `rtmsg_ifinfo` to send an appropriate message to userspace.

2. `rtnetlink_dev_notifier` is a notifier block that gets notified about network device events and calls the `rtnetlink_event` function when necessary.

3. `rtnetlink_net_init` initializes the rtnetlink subsystem for a specific network namespace. It creates a new NETLINK socket of type NETLINK_ROUTE and sets up the input callback function (`rtnetlink_rcv`) to handle incoming messages from userspace.

4. `rtnetlink_net_exit` cleans up the rtnetlink subsystem for a specific network namespace when it's no longer needed. It releases the NETLINK socket that was created in `rtnetlink_net_init`.

5. `rtnetlink_net_ops` is a pernet_operations structure that defines the init and exit functions to be called during network namespace initialization and cleanup, respectively.

6. The `rtnetlink_init` function initializes the rtnetlink subsystem globally. It performs various setup tasks such as allocating memory for attribute buffers, registering the pernet operations structure, and registering notifiers for device events. It also registers different types of NETLINK messages (such as RTM_GETLINK, RTM_SETLINK, RTM_NEWLINK, etc.) along with their corresponding callback functions.

In summary, this code sets up the rtnetlink subsystem to handle network configuration tasks by initializing data structures and registering event notifiers/callbacks for various types of messages and events that can occur in a networked system.
