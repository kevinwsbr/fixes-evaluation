 This is the source code for a video decoder in FFmpeg that can decode Chronomaster DFA videos. The DFA format consists of chunks with different types, such as frame data and color palette. Each chunk has a size and type, and the decoder processes these chunks one by one to reconstruct the video frames.

   The `dfa_decode_frame` function is called for each packet in the input stream, and it initializes an AVFrame structure with the decoded data. It reads the chunk type and size from the input data, and then calls a corresponding function based on the chunk type to decode the chunk data. If the chunk type is 1 (color palette), it updates the color palette in the frame. For other chunk types, it decodes the frame data using one of the decoding functions defined earlier in the source code.

   After decoding all chunks for a packet, the function copies the decoded frame data to the AVFrame structure and marks it as having been decoded successfully. Finally, it returns the size of the input packet.
