  This is a C++ program that creates a simple web server using the boost libraries. The server listens for incoming connections on port 80 and responds with an HTML page that says "Hello World" when it receives a request from a client.

The main() function first initializes several Boost libraries, including the Boost::asio library, which provides asynchronous I/O functionality, and the Boost::beast library, which provides HTTP message parsing and serialization capabilities. The program then defines a few constants, such as the port number that the server will listen on (80) and the HTML response string ("Hello World").

Then, the program creates an Asio io_context object, which is used to manage the I/O operations of the HTTP server. It also creates a Beast HTTP listener, which listens for incoming HTTP requests on the specified port and accepts them when they arrive. When a request is accepted, it uses the Boost::beast::http::read() function to read the request message from the client and parse its headers and body.

Once the request has been parsed, the program uses the Boost::beast::http::write() function to send an HTTP response back to the client, which contains a simple HTML page that says "Hello World". The server then closes the connection with the client using the Boost::asio::ip::tcp::socket::shutdown() and Boost::asio::ip::tcp::socket::close() functions.

Overall, this program is an example of how to use the Boost libraries to create a simple web server that can handle HTTP requests from clients. The code is well-structured, with clear comments explaining each part of the program.
