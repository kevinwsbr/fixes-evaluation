 This is a kernel module for SCSI RDMA Protocol (SRP) target implemented in C. The module provides the necessary functions to interface with the InfiniBand (IB) subsystem and the Linux Target Core framework. It registers as an IB client and sets up the required function pointers for various operations such as checking stop-free, shutting down a session, closing a session, writing pending data, setting default node attributes, getting command state, queuing data in, queuing status, queuing task management response, handling aborted tasks, making WWN (World Wide Name), dropping WWN, making transport group page (TPG), dropping TPG, and initializing node access control list.

The `srpt_init_module()` function is called when the module is loaded into the kernel. It first checks if the value of the `srp_max_req_size` parameter is valid. If it's not within the allowed range, an error message will be printed and the initialization will fail. Next, it registers the SRP target template with the Linux Target Core framework. Finally, it registers as an IB client using `ib_register_client()`.

The `srpt_cleanup_module()` function is called when the module is removed from the kernel. It unregisters as an IB client and then unregisters the SRP target template from the Linux Target Core framework.
