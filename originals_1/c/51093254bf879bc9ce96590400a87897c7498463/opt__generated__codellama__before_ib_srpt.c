  This is the main entry point of the SRPT driver. It registers with the kernel as a target driver and initializes the Fabric Module.

1. The `srpt_client` structure is defined in `srpt_client.h`. It contains function pointers to callbacks that are called by the ibverbs library.
2. The `srpt_template` structure is defined in `srpt_target.c`. It contains function pointers to callbacks that are called by the target core.
3. `srpt_init_module()` is called when the module is loaded into memory. It registers with the kernel as a target driver and initializes the Fabric Module.
4. `srpt_cleanup_module()` is called when the module is unloaded from memory. It unregisters with the kernel as a target driver.
5. The `srpt_make_tport()` function creates a new Target Port Group (TPG) for the Fabric Module.
6. The `srpt_drop_tport()` function destroys an existing TPG for the Fabric Module.
7. The `srpt_make_tpg()` function is called when a new TPG is created. It initializes the TPG and allocates memory for it.
8. The `srpt_drop_tpg()` function is called when a TPG is destroyed. It frees any resources allocated to the TPG.
9. The `srpt_init_nodeacl()` function initializes the node ACL (Access Control List) for the TPG.
10. The `srpt_fabric_make_wwn()` function creates a new WWN (World Wide Name) in the Fabric Module.
11. The `srpt_fabric_drop_wwn()` function destroys an existing WWN in the Fabric Module.
12. The `srpt_fabric_make_tpg()` function creates a new TPG in the Fabric Module.
13. The `srpt_fabric_drop_tpg()` function destroys an existing TPG in the Fabric Module.
14. The `srpt_add_one()` function is called when a new SRP Target is added to the system. It initializes the SRPT device and sets up the necessary queues for handling incoming requests.
15. The `srpt_remove_one()` function is called when an SRP Target is removed from the system. It tears down the SRPT device and frees any resources allocated to it.
16. The `srpt_set_default_node_attributes()` function sets the default node attributes for the TPG.
17. The `srpt_get_cmd_state()` function returns the current state of a SCSI command.
18. The `srpt_queue_data_in()` function queues an incoming data-IN request to the SRPT device.
19. The `srpt_queue_status()` function queues an incoming status request to the SRPT device.
20. The `srpt_queue_tm_rsp()` function queues an incoming task management response to the SRPT device.
21. The `srpt_write_pending()` function is called when a SCSI command has data that needs to be written to the device. It sends the data to the remote target over the RDMA connection.
22. The `srpt_write_pending_status()` function is called when a SCSI command has status information that needs to be sent back to the initiator. It sends the status information to the remote target over the RDMA connection.
23. The `srpt_aborted_task()` function is called when a SCSI task is aborted by the initiator. It updates the SRPT device's state and notifies the remote target of the abortion.
