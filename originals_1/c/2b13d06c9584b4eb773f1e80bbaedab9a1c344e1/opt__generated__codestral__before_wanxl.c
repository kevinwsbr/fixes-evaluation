 This is a Linux kernel module source code for the SBE Inc. wanXL serial port driver. The module supports three different PCI devices: WANXL100, WANXL200, and WANXL400.

Here's a brief explanation of some key functions in the code:

- `wanxl_pci_init_one`: This function is called when a compatible PCI device is found during the probing process. It initializes the card, allocates IRQ, and sets up HDLC devices for each port on the card. The number of ports depends on the type of the PCI device.
- `wanxl_pci_remove_one`: This function is called when the driver is being removed or when an error occurs during initialization. It releases resources and unregisters HDLC devices.
- `wanxl_attach` and `wanxl_xmit`: These functions are used to attach and transmit data through the HDLC device, respectively.
- `wanxl_init_module`: This function is called when the module is loaded into the kernel. It registers the PCI driver.
- `wanxl_cleanup_module`: This function is called when the module is being unloaded from the kernel. It unregisters the PCI driver.
