  This is the kernel's source code for the TCP protocol. It contains functions that perform various tasks related to establishing, maintaining, and closing connections over a network using the TCP protocol. The exported functions are listed in the comment section at the beginning of the code.

Some of the functions exported include:

* `tcp_close` - Closes a socket and frees its resources.
* `tcp_disconnect` - Disconnects a socket from its peer.
* `tcp_getsockopt` - Gets options related to a socket.
* `tcp_ioctl` - Performs various low-level operations on sockets, such as setting or getting IP addresses and ports.
* `tcp_poll` - Polls the state of a socket to determine whether it is readable or writable.
* `tcp_read_sock` - Reads data from a socket.
* `tcp_recvmsg` - Receives data from a socket in a manner similar to `read(2)`.
* `tcp_sendmsg` - Sends data to a socket in a manner similar to `write(2)`.
* `tcp_splice_read` - Splices data from one file descriptor to another.
* `tcp_sendpage` - Sends data from a page cache to a socket.
* `tcp_setsockopt` - Sets options related to a socket.
* `tcp_shutdown` - Closes a socket for reading or writing, or both.
