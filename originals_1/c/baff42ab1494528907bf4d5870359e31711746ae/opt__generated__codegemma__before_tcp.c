**Summary**

The code snippet you provided appears to be a C function called `tcp_init()` that initializes the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) subsystem. It performs various tasks such as:

- Configuring hash tables for TCP connections and bindings.
- Adjusting default sysctl parameters based on available memory.
- Setting per-socket memory limits.
- Registering the TCP Reno congestion control algorithm.
- Initializing TCP secret values.

**Key Points**

- **Hash Tables:** The function creates hash tables for TCP established connections (`tcp_hashinfo.ehash`) and TCP bindings (`tcp_hashinfo.bhash`).
- **Sysctl Parameters:** It adjusts sysctl parameters related to TCP memory usage, maximum orphaned connections, and SYN backlog.
- **Socket Memory Limits:** It sets per-socket memory limits for read and write operations.
- **Congestion Control:** It registers the TCP Reno congestion control algorithm.
- **Secret Values:** It initializes TCP secret values used for authentication.

**Functionality**

The function performs the following steps:

1. Configures hash tables for TCP connections and bindings.
2. Adjusts sysctl parameters based on available memory.
3. Sets per-socket memory limits.
4. Registers the TCP Reno congestion control algorithm.
5. Initializes TCP secret values.
6. Prints a message indicating that TCP has been initialized.

**Export Symbols**

The function exports various symbols used by the TCP subsystem, including functions related to socket operations, congestion control, and secret management.

**Conclusion**

The `tcp_init()` function is responsible for initializing the TCP subsystem and configuring various parameters and settings. It plays a crucial role in enabling TCP communication on a system.
