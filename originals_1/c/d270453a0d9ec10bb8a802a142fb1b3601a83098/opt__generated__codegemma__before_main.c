**Module Initialization:**

* The `nfcmrvl_nci_register_dev()` function initializes the NFC module by allocating memory for the `nfcmrvl_private` structure, setting up GPIO pins, and registering the NCI device.
* The `nfcmrvl_parse_dt()` function parses the device tree node to retrieve configuration options such as the reset GPIO pin and HCI muxing setting.

**Data Reception:**

* The `nfcmrvl_nci_recv_frame()` function receives NFC data and handles it based on the following conditions:
    * If HCI muxing is enabled, it extracts the NCI payload from the HCI event packet.
    * If firmware download is in progress, it forwards the data to the firmware download handler.
    * If the NCI is running, it passes the data to the NCI device for handling.

**Device Unregistration:**

* The `nfcmrvl_nci_unregister_dev()` function handles device unregistration by:
    * Aborting firmware download if necessary.
    * Uninitializing firmware download settings.
    * Freeing GPIO pins.
    * Unregistering the NCI device.
    * Releasing memory allocated for the `nfcmrvl_private` structure.

**Other Functions:**

* `nfcmrvl_chip_reset()` resets the NFC chip by asserting the reset GPIO pin.
* `nfcmrvl_chip_halt()` sets the reset GPIO pin to low, halting the chip.

**Key Features:**

* NCI (Near Field Communication Interface) support
* HCI muxing configuration
* Firmware download support
* Chip reset and halt functionality

**Usage:**

The NFC module is typically initialized and used by an NFC application or framework. It handles the underlying NCI communication and provides an interface for interacting with NFC devices.
