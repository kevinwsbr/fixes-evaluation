 The provided code snippets are part of a Linux kernel module for handling SMB/CIFS file locking and lease management. They implement functions to send lock requests (`smb2_lockv`) and break leases (`SMB2_lease_break`). Below is an overview and explanation of each function:

### 1. `smb2_lockv`
This function sends a lock request using SMB/CIFS over the network. It constructs a SMB2_LOCK request, fills it with the necessary parameters (like persistent and volatile file IDs, process ID, number of locks, and lock elements), and then sends it to the server.

- **Parameters:**
  - `xid`: Transaction identifier.
  - `tcon`: Connection handle to the server.
  - `persist_fid`, `volatile_fid`: File identifiers for persistent and volatile metadata.
  - `pid`: Process ID.
  - `num_lock`: Number of lock elements to be sent.
  - `buf`: Buffer containing the lock elements.

- **Steps:**
  1. Initialize a SMB2_LOCK request.
  2. Set process ID, number of locks, and persistent/volatile file IDs in the request.
  3. Calculate the size of the payload including the RFC1002 header adjustments.
  4. Prepare iovec for sending: one vector for the request structure and another for the lock elements buffer.
  5. Increment the appropriate statistics counters.
  6. Send the request using `SendReceive2` and handle the response or errors.

### 2. `SMB2_lock`
This function simplifies the process of locking a file by creating a single lock element and calling `smb2_lockv` with it. It is used to lock a file for either immediate (default) or fail-immediately mode based on the `wait` parameter.

- **Parameters:**
  - `xid`: Transaction identifier.
  - `tcon`: Connection handle to the server.
  - `persist_fid`, `volatile_fid`: File identifiers for persistent and volatile metadata.
  - `pid`: Process ID.
  - `length`, `offset`: Length and offset of the lock range.
  - `lock_flags`: Flags specifying the type of lock (e.g., shared, exclusive).
  - `wait`: Boolean indicating whether to wait for the lock operation to complete or fail immediately.

- **Steps:**
  1. Create a single lock element with specified offset and length.
  2. Call `smb2_lockv` with this lock element and appropriate parameters.

### 3. `SMB2_lease_break`
This function sends a request to break an SMB lease (oplock) on the server. It constructs a SMB2_OPLOCK_BREAK request, fills it with necessary parameters (like lease key and state), and then sends it.

- **Parameters:**
  - `xid`: Transaction identifier.
  - `tcon`: Connection handle to the server.
  - `lease_key`: Key associated with the lease.
  - `lease_state`: State of the lease being broken.

- **Steps:**
  1. Initialize a SMB2_OPLOCK_BREAK request.
  2. Set the credit request and structure size in the request.
  3. Copy the lease key into the request.
  4. Send the request using `SendReceiveNoRsp` and handle the response or errors.

### Error Handling
- Both `smb2_lockv` and `SMB2_lease_break` increment appropriate statistics on error to track failures, which can be useful for diagnostics and performance monitoring.
- Errors are logged with debug messages (`cifs_dbg`) if they occur during the sending or receiving stages of the network operation.

These functions form a part of a larger set of SMB/CIFS client operations in the Linux kernel, providing essential support for file locking mechanisms over network filesystems that use SMB as a protocol.
