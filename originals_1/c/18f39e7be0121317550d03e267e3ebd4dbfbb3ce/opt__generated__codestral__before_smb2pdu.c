 The provided code snippet is a set of functions that are used for sending SMB2 commands to a remote server. Here's a breakdown of each function:

1. `SMB2_lockv`: This function sends an SMB2 lock command with multiple lock elements (specified by the `num_lock` parameter) to the remote server. It initializes a request structure, sets the appropriate fields such as process ID, persistent and volatile file IDs, and lock count. It then sends the request using the `SendReceive2` function. If an error occurs during sending or receiving, it increments the corresponding failure counter in the statistics.

2. `SMB2_lock`: This function sends a single SMB2 lock command to the remote server. It initializes a lock element structure and calls the `smb2_lockv` function with `num_lock` set to 1.

3. `SMB2_lease_break`: This function sends an SMB2 lease break command to the remote server. It initializes a request structure, sets the appropriate fields such as credit request, structure size, and lease key, and sends the request using the `SendReceiveNoRsp` function. If an error occurs during sending or receiving, it increments the corresponding failure counter in the statistics.

These functions are used for managing locks on remote files and breaking leases, which are necessary for certain file operations such as renaming and deleting files that are open by other processes. The specific implementation details may vary depending on the underlying CIFS (Common Internet File System) protocol version and server capabilities.
