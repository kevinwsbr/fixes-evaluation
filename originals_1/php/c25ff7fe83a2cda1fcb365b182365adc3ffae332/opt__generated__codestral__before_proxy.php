 This is a PHP script that acts as a proxy to fetch and serve files from external URLs. It's designed for use with the LMeve/1.0 API Poller in WebGL context. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. Checks if WebGL Proxy is enabled. If not, it logs an error and stops execution.
2. If proxy caching is enabled, it checks for the requested file in the database cache. If the file exists in the cache, it serves the cached version to reduce load on external servers.
3. If the file isn't in the cache, it uses CURL to download the file from the provided URL. It then handles any potential errors that might occur during the CURL operation.
4. If there's no error and proxy caching is enabled, the script saves the retrieved file to the database for future use.
5. Finally, if all goes well, it serves the file to the requester with appropriate headers.

This script also logs various details about each request for auditing purposes, such as IP address, fetch status (OK or error), referrer, URL of the fetched file, HTTP response code, and size of the data.

Please note that this script requires a valid MySQL connection to work with proxy caching. Make sure to replace `$LM_CCPWGL_CACHESCHEMA` with your actual database schema name. Also, ensure that the server has CURL installed and enabled for proper functioning.
