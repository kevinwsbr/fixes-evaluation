 The code snippet provided is a class with several methods related to managing and retrieving information about cart products in an application. Let's break down the main functionalities of this class:

1. `getRelatedItemsDiscount` - This method calculates any discount that might be applicable for a given cart product based on its relationship with other items in the same cart. It checks if there are any promos associated with the cart and retrieves a related discount based on the list of products, the current product, and its configuration.

2. `getItemTitle` - This method returns the title of a cart product. If the product has a service that defines a custom `getCartProductTitle` method, it uses that to retrieve the title; otherwise, it defaults to using the `title` property of the product.

3. `getItemPromoDiscount` - This method calculates any discount on a given cart product based on a promo associated with the cart. It retrieves the product and its configuration, then uses a repository object to calculate the discount.

4. `getItemConfig` - This method decodes the JSON-encoded configuration data for a given cart product.

5. `cartProductToApiArray` - This method converts a cart product object into an array that can be returned as part of an API response. It retrieves information about the product, such as its setup price and unit, and calculates any applicable discounts.

6. `getProductDiscount` - This method calculates the total discount for a given cart product by adding together any related item discounts and promo-based discounts (for both price and setup).
