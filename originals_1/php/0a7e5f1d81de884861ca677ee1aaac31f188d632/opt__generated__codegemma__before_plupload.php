**Purpose:**

The provided PHP code snippet handles image uploads using the Plupload JavaScript library. It performs tasks such as:

- Validating uploaded files
- Resizing images if they exceed a specified size
- Logging upload events
- Sending JSON-RPC responses

**Key Functions:**

- **upload_image()**: The main function that handles the image upload process.
- **is_image()**: Function to determine if a file is an image.
- **resize_image()**: Function to resize an image if its size exceeds a threshold.

**Code Breakdown:**

**upload_image() Function:**

- Checks the upload status and throws an exception if necessary.
- Determines the file extension and checks if it's a valid image.
- Logs the upload event.
- Resizes the image if it exceeds the specified size.
- Returns an array containing the upload status and image information.

**is_image() Function:**

- Uses the `exif_imagetype()` function to determine the image type.
- Returns `true` if the image type is valid, `false` otherwise.

**resize_image() Function:**

- Calculates the new image dimensions to maintain aspect ratio.
- Creates a new GD image resource.
- Resizes the image using `imagecopyresampled()`.
- Saves the resized image to the specified file path.

**Code Flow:**

1. The `upload_image()` function is called with the uploaded file path as an argument.
2. The function validates the file, logs the event, and resizes the image if necessary.
3. The function returns a JSON-RPC response containing the upload status and image information.

**Additional Notes:**

- The code uses the Moxiecode Systems AB's Plupload JavaScript library.
- The `upload.php` file serves as the PHP endpoint for image uploads.
- The code includes error handling for different upload errors.

**Overall Functionality:**

The code performs the following tasks:

- Uploads an image to a server.
- Resizes the image if it exceeds a certain size.
- Logs the upload event.
- Returns a JSON-RPC response indicating the upload status and image information.
