 This is a PHP script that contains several functions related to handling student publications or works in an educational platform. Here's a brief explanation of each function:

1. `compilatioUpdateWorkDocument($docId, $courseId)`: This function updates the work document in both the file system and the database. It renames files with missing extensions based on their title and then updates the URL in the database accordingly.

2. `workDocExtension($docId, $courseId)`: This function retrieves the extension of a work document's title from the database using its document ID and course ID.

3. `getFileExtension($filename)`: This function extracts and returns the file extension from a given filename string.

4. `getWorkTitle($docId, $courseId)`: This function fetches and returns the title of a work document from the database using its document ID and course ID.

5. `getFilename($txt)`: This function extracts and returns the filename from a given URL or path string.

6. `getWorkFolder($txt)`: This function extracts and returns the folder/directory path of a work document from a given URL or path string.

7. `getShortFilename($txt)`: This function returns a shortened version of the filename (up to 10 characters) if it's longer than that, otherwise, it returns the original filename.
