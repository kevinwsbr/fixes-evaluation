 This is a PHP script that displays a support ticket response page. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. It first checks if there are any replies to the ticket, and if so, it displays each reply in a table format, showing the author, timestamp, response text, and action taken (if any). If there are no replies, it displays a message stating so.
2. If the ticket status is not 'Resolved' or 'Closed', it provides a form for staff members to add a new reply to the ticket. The form includes fields for the response text and radio buttons for selecting the appropriate action to take on the ticket (such as 'Mark as In Progress' or 'Close Ticket').
3. If the ticket ID is not provided, it displays an error message stating "Huh?".

The script uses the Flux framework, which provides a way to manage messages and configurations in the application. The `Flux::message()` function is used to retrieve localized messages for display on the page, while `Flux::config('StaffReplyColour')` is used to retrieve the configured color for staff replies.
