**User Authentication and Logout Functionality in PHP**

The provided PHP code snippet implements user authentication and logout functionality for a web application.

**Key Features:**

- User authentication using username and password or cookies.
- User object with methods for loading, saving, and verifying credentials.
- Cookie management for storing user session data.
- IP address filtering and logging.

**Authentication Process:**

1. User submits username and password.
2. Code checks if username exists and password matches.
3. If successful, user object is updated with last activity and log key.
4. Cookies are set with user session data.

**Logout Process:**

1. Cookies are cleared to end user session.

**Key Methods:**

- `userAuth()`: Authenticates user based on username and password or cookies.
- `cookieAuth()`: Authenticates user based on cookies.
- `updateCookies()`: Updates user cookies with session data.
- `userLogout()`: Logs out user by clearing cookies.

**Additional Notes:**

- The code uses a `User` model to represent users.
- The `ToolBox` class provides utility functions for IP filtering, logging, etc.
- The `FS_ROUTE` constant defines the application route.
- The `FS_COOKIES_EXPIRE` constant specifies the cookie expiration time.
- The `USER_UPDATE_ACTIVITY_PERIOD` constant defines the interval for updating user activity in cookies.

**Improvements:**

- Implement a more robust password hashing mechanism.
- Add session management for improved security.
- Implement a CSRF protection mechanism.

**Overall, the code provides a functional and secure user authentication and logout system.**
