 This code is for handling file uploads in a web application. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. It checks the file extension against a blacklist to prevent malicious files from being uploaded. If the file extension is found in the blacklist, an error message is displayed and the upload process is halted.

2. The code also includes a feature to check for hidden extensions, where someone might try to upload a PHP file but rename it as a JPG file. This is done by checking the MIME type of the file using the `finfo_open` function in PHP. If the MIME type indicates that the file is actually a PHP or HTML file, the upload process is halted and an error message is displayed.

3. The code then moves the uploaded file to its target directory with appropriate permissions and updates the list of uploaded files. Finally, it returns 1 if the upload was successful or -1 if there was an error.
