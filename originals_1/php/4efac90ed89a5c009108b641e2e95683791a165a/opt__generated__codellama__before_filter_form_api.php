This code defines a class called `FilterBoxGridLayout` that extends the `TableGridLayout` class and overrides some of its methods to generate HTML code for a filter form table with a specific structure. The class is used in the `print_filter_form` function to display the filter form in a grid layout.

The `render_td_item_header` method generates an HTML `<td>` element for the header part of a filter form item. It outputs the header text, followed by a closing `</td>` tag. The `render_td_item_content` method does the same for the content part of a filter form item.

The `render_td_empty_header` method generates an empty `<td>` element with the class "category" and a colspan attribute if necessary. This is used to create empty columns in the filter form table.

Overall, this code defines a custom layout for the filter form that displays the different fields in a grid format. The resulting HTML structure will be similar to the one shown in the example image.
