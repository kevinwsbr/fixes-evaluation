 The provided code is a utility class containing several static methods that perform various operations. Here's a breakdown of each method:

1. `random_bytes($length, $raw = false)`: This method generates random bytes of the specified length. It first checks if the PHP7 function `random_bytes()` exists and uses it to generate random bytes. If that function is not available, it falls back to using `openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()`. The generated random bytes can be returned in raw format or converted to a readable format (containing only a-zA-Z0-9 characters) using the `bin2ascii()` method.

2. `bin2ascii($input)`: This method converts binary data into a readable form containing only a-zA-Z0-9 characters. It uses a similar approach to the `bin_to_readable()` function in ext/session/session.c of PHP.

3. `date_format($format = null)`: This method formats the current date according to the specified format. If no format is provided, it defaults to 'd-M-Y H:i:s O'. It supports microseconds by using the 'u' character in the format string.

4. `max_upload_size()`: This method determines the maximum upload size by finding the minimum value between the `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size` configurations in PHP. It uses a helper function `parse_bytes()` to convert the byte values from their human-readable format (e.g., "2M", "1G") to bytes.
