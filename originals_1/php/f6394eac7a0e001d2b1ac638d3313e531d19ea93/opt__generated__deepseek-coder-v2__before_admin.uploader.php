 The provided PHP code snippet is a part of a function designed to handle file uploads, specifically for an admin uploader. It includes checks and validations to ensure that the uploaded files are safe and do not contain blacklisted extensions or MIME types. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. **Initialization and Setup**: The snippet starts by initializing variables and setting up some configurations. This includes defining blacklist extensions, image extensions, and other necessary settings.

2. **Loop Through Uploaded Files**: It iterates through each file that was uploaded via an admin uploader. For each file, it performs several checks:
   - **Check for Blacklisted Extensions**: If the number of possible extensions (`$extcount`) is 2 or more, it only considers the last two extensions to check against a blacklist defined in `$blacklist_extensions`.
   - **MIME Type Check (for PHP and HTML Files)**: It uses `finfo_open` and `finfo_file` functions from the `fileinfo` extension to check if the MIME type of the file is either "text/x-php" or "text/html". If so, it rejects the upload.
   - **Sanitization and Moving File**: It sanitizes the filename by removing any potentially harmful characters and constructs a target path for saving the file. The file is then moved to this location using `move_uploaded_file`.

3. **Handling Errors**: Throughout these checks, if an error occurs (e.g., a blacklisted extension is found or move operation fails), it sets `$isForbidden` to true and returns -1, indicating an upload failure.

4. **Completion and Return**: If all files pass the checks successfully, it updates Smarty templates with success status and adds uploaded files to the session for later use before returning 1, which typically means a successful upload.

This function is crucial for security in file uploads, especially in environments where users might try to exploit file upload functionalities to inject malicious scripts or other harmful content. The checks included help mitigate risks associated with unrestricted file uploads and potential command execution via PHP files.
