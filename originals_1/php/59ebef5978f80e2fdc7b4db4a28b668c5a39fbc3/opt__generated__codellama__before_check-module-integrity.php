The given code has several security vulnerabilities:

1. SQL Injection: The code uses `$_GET["id"]` directly in a SQL query without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code and perform a SQL injection attack.
2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The code uses the user input `$_GET["external"]` directly in a PHP statement without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that can be executed on the server, leading to a reflected XSS attack.
3. Open Redirect: The code uses the user input `$_GET["id"]` directly in a URL redirection. This allows an attacker to redirect the user to any URL they choose, including a phishing website or a malicious website that can steal sensitive information.
4. Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR): The code uses the user input `$_GET["form"]` directly to access a form object without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to access any form on the server, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data leakage.
5. Insufficient Error Handling: The code does not properly handle errors and exceptions, which can lead to sensitive information disclosure or other security issues.

To fix these vulnerabilities, the following changes should be made:

1. Validate and sanitize user input: Use prepared statements with bound parameters to prevent SQL injection attacks.
2. Validate and sanitize URL inputs: Use a secure URL validation function to check for valid URLs before using them in redirections or other URL-based operations.
3. Implement proper error handling: Catch and handle all exceptions properly, including errors related to missing or invalid input data. Provide clear error messages and log the errors for further analysis.
4. Use secure direct object reference (DOR): Use a secure DOR technique to access forms and other objects based on user-provided inputs, rather than using direct references.
5. Use a secure way of accessing form fields: Instead of using `$form["fields"][$field]["title"]`, use a safer way of accessing form fields, such as using a secure input validation function to validate the field names before using them in SQL queries or URL redirections.
