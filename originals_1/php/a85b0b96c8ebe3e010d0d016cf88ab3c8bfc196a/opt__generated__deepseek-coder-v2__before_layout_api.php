 The provided code snippet is written in PHP and appears to be part of a larger script that handles the display of various metrics, such as memory usage, query execution count, and total query time. It also includes functions for rendering the opening and closing markup for the footer section, and a function to render a scroll-up button.

Here's a breakdown of what each section does:

1. **Memory Usage Display:**
   - The script checks if memory usage should be displayed (`config_get('show_memory_usage')`). If true, it calculates the peak memory usage in kilobytes using `memory_get_peak_usage()`, formats it with a language string (`lang_get('memory_usage_in_kb'`), and prints it out.

2. **Query Execution Count:**
   - It checks if query count should be displayed (`config_get('show_queries_count')`). If true, it initializes variables to track the total number of queries, unique queries, and their execution times. It iterates over `$g_queries_array`, checking for duplicates using `in_array()` to determine whether a query is unique or not. It updates counts accordingly and prints out the total and unique queries executed along with their execution time.

3. **Footer Markup:**
   - The script includes two functions, `layout_footer_begin()` and `layout_footer_end()`, which are used to print opening and closing HTML tags for the footer section respectively. These functions wrap the code in a `<div>` with class names that help style it appropriately on the page.

4. **Scroll-Up Button:**
   - The function `layout_scroll_up_button()` prints an anchor (`<a>`) element that, when clicked, will scroll the user back to the top of the page. It includes a Bootstrap button class for styling and an icon indicating the action.

5. **Logging Events Table:**
   - Finally, it calls `log_print_to_page()`, which presumably fetches and prints any log events stored in `$g_queries_array` or similar structures.

6. **General Structure:**
   - The script checks if any of the metrics (memory usage, query count, or timer) are to be displayed using `config_get`. If so, it wraps the entire output in a `<div>` with appropriate classes for styling and ensures that HTML structure follows a consistent pattern, starting with opening tags for layout and ending with closing tags.

This script is designed to provide real-time information about resource usage (memory and query execution) during the operation of a web application, which can be useful for debugging and performance monitoring.
