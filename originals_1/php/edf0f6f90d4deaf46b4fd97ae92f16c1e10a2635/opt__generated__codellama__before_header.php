The code above is an example of how a top bar navigation menu can be implemented in PHP and HTML. The top bar navigation menu typically includes various options such as the user's profile, language selection, logout button, and search bar. The `LanguageHelper` class used here is responsible for rendering select boxes with all available languages.

The code uses the `Gravatar` class to display a user's avatar image, which requires an email address to be provided in order to generate the hash that identifies their Gravatar. If Gravatar support has been disabled through configuration, then a default icon is displayed instead of the Gravatar image.

The `navbar-text` element is used to add a text block above the navigation menu, which displays the session expiration time for the user. The `sessioncounter` variable is initially set to a loading spinner that is rotating while PHP code is being executed on the server. Once the server responds with the data, this value is updated and displayed as the actual session counter.

The `topbar-divider` element separates the user profile information from the search bar, and the `dropdown-menu` element is used to provide a list of options for the user, including their password change option, which is only available if they are logged in or have administrative privileges.
