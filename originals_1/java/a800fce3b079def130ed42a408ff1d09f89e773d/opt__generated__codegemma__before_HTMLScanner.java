**HTMLScanner Class**

The provided code snippet defines a `HTMLScanner` class that appears to be responsible for parsing and analyzing HTML content. It includes methods for checking references, ending with strings, reading characters, and handling end comments.

**Key Features:**

* **Reference Checking:** The `checkReference()` method verifies if a reference is equal to a decoded version of itself.
* **String Matching:** The `endsWith()` method checks if a buffer ends with a specific string.
* **Character Reading:** The `readPreservingBufferContent()` method reads a single character from the buffer while preserving the original content.
* **End Comment Handling:** The `endCommentAvailable()` method determines if an end comment is available in the buffer.
* **Buffer Reduction:** The `reduceToContent()` method extracts the content between start and end markers, ignoring whitespace before and after.

**Usage:**

The `HTMLScanner` class likely performs tasks such as:

* Parsing HTML tags and attributes.
* Identifying and extracting content within HTML comments.
* Recognizing and handling different HTML entities.

**Potential Applications:**

The `HTMLScanner` class could be used in various scenarios where HTML content needs to be analyzed, such as:

* Web development frameworks
* Text editors and code editors
* Data extraction tools

**Additional Notes:**

* The code includes debugging statements for buffer content.
* The `DEBUG_BUFFER` constant is likely used to enable or disable these statements.
* The `XMLStringBuffer` class is assumed to be a custom data structure used to store the HTML buffer.

**Conclusion:**

The `HTMLScanner` class provides a set of methods for handling and analyzing HTML content, including reference checking, string matching, character reading, end comment handling, and buffer reduction. It is a valuable tool for developers working with HTML data.
