The code snippet is written in Python and is intended to provide various hashing functions, including SHA-256, SHA-512, SHA-384, MD5, SHA-224, and BLAKE2. However, there are several security vulnerabilities in the code that should be addressed:

1. The `Standard_Multi_Hash` function is not properly implemented and contains several bugs that can lead to incorrect hashes being generated. Specifically, the use of `hashlib.sha512()` and `hashlib.md5()` in a single function is risky, as they are both vulnerable to collision attacks.
2. The `Salt` function does not properly handle salt values that are not bytes or strings. In the current implementation, if a non-string value is passed as the `salt` parameter, an exception will be raised. However, this can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities if an attacker can control the input data.
3. The `SHA256`, `SHA512`, `SHA384`, `MD5`, `SHA224`, and `BLAKE2` functions do not properly handle input data that is not a string or bytes object. In the current implementation, if an object other than a string or bytes is passed as the `data` parameter, an exception will be raised. However, this can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities if an attacker can control the input data.
4. The `Standard_Multi_Hash` function does not properly handle edge cases such as empty strings, null values, or malformed data. In the current implementation, if the `Data` parameter is empty or null, the function will raise an exception. However, this can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities if an attacker can control the input data.
5. The `Salt` function does not properly handle edge cases such as empty strings, null values, or malformed data. In the current implementation, if the `salt` parameter is empty or null, the function will raise an exception. However, this can lead to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities if an attacker can control the input data.

To fix these vulnerabilities, the code should be updated to properly handle edge cases, validate input data, and use safer hashing functions such as `hashlib.sha256()` or `hashlib.sha512()`. Additionally, the `Standard_Multi_Hash` function should be rewritten to use safer hashing functions and avoid using vulnerable ones like `hashlib.md5()`.
