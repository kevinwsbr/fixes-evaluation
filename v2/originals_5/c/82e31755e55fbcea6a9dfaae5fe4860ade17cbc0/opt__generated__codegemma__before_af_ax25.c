**Module Name:** ax25

**Description:**

The ax25 module implements the Amateur Radio AX.25 link layer protocol. It provides the necessary functionality for establishing and managing connections between amateur radio stations.

**Key Features:**

- Supports the AX.25 protocol, including routing, signaling, and data transmission.
- Provides a virtual network interface (VNI) for communication over AX.25 links.
- Implements a packet type for AX.25 frames.
- Registers a network device notifier to handle device events.
- Creates sequences for displaying AX.25 information in the /proc/net directory.

**Module Initialization:**

- Registers the AX.25 protocol with the kernel.
- Registers the AX.25 family with the socket layer.
- Sets up a packet type for AX.25 frames.
- Creates sequences for displaying AX.25 information in the /proc/net directory.

**Module Exit:**

- Removes the sequences for displaying AX.25 information.
- Unregisters the network device notifier.
- Removes the packet type for AX.25 frames.
- Unregisters the AX.25 family with the socket layer.
- Unregisters the AX.25 protocol with the kernel.

**Module Usage:**

- To use the ax25 module, an amateur radio station must first establish an AX.25 link.
- The ax25 module will then handle the routing, signaling, and data transmission for that link.

**Module Limitations:**

- The ax25 module is primarily intended for use by amateur radio stations.
- It may not be suitable for other applications.

**Additional Notes:**

- The module requires the `ax25-utils` package for additional functionality.
- The module documentation can be found in the Linux kernel documentation.
