 This is a code snippet from the FFmpeg project that defines a demuxer for Phantom Cine files. The demuxer is responsible for extracting data from the input file format and making it available to the rest of the FFmpeg library for decoding or further processing.

   The `cine_read_probe` function determines if the provided AVFormatContext can be handled by this demuxer. It checks if the input data has a specific header pattern that is unique to Phantom Cine files.

   The `cine_read_header` function reads and parses the header of the input file, extracting metadata such as shutter speed, image dimensions, description, and cropping information. It also builds an index of the image offsets within the file for faster seeking.

   The `cine_read_packet` function reads a single packet (or frame) from the input file based on the current position in the index. This function is called repeatedly by FFmpeg to decode and process each frame of the video stream.

   The `cine_read_seek` function allows seeking to a specific timestamp within the input file, enabling features such as fast forwarding and rewinding. In this implementation, only timestamp-based seeking is supported; byte and frame-based seeking are not implemented.

   Finally, the `ff_cine_demuxer` structure registers the demuxer with FFmpeg, providing information about its name, private data size, and callback functions for probing, reading headers, packets, and handling seek requests.
