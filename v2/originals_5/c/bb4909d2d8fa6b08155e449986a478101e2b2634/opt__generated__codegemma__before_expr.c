## Modifications and Improvements

Based on the provided code, here are some observations and potential improvements:

**Improvements:**

* **Error Handling:** The code lacks proper error handling for various situations. For example, it doesn't check for invalid input, such as out-of-range values in the `EXPR_MULTIPLY` and `EXPR_DIVIDE` cases.
* **Code Readability:** The code can be improved by adding comments to explain the purpose of certain functions and operations.
* **Code Formatting:** The code could be formatted consistently to improve readability and maintainability.
* **Code Coverage:** The code doesn't cover all possible expression types and operators. It's important to test and ensure the code handles all expected scenarios.

**Specific Observations:**

* The `ExprResolveMaskLookup()` function needs to be improved to handle invalid input, such as illegal operations or division by zero.
* The `ExprResolveModMask()` function assumes that the `mods` parameter is valid. It should be checked for validity before accessing its elements.
* The `ExprResolveKeySym()` function doesn't handle cases where the input is not a valid keysym.
* The `ExprResolveMod()` function should validate the `mod_type` parameter to ensure it's a valid modifier type.

**Additional Improvements:**

* The code could be extended to support more expression types and operators.
* The code could be made more generic by using a template or similar mechanism to handle different expression types.
* The code could be integrated with a unit testing framework to ensure comprehensive testing.

**Overall, the code could be improved by adding error handling, improving readability, and expanding its functionality.**
