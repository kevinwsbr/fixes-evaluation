  This function is used to resolve a modifier expression in the form of an `ExprDef` object. It takes several arguments:

  - `ctx`: The context in which the resolver should operate.
  - `expr`: The `ExprDef` object that represents the modifier expression.
  - `mod_type`: The type of virtual modifier to resolve. This can be `VIRTUAL_MOD_KEY`, `VIRTUAL_MOD_LATCH`, or `VIRTUAL_MOD_LOCK`.
  - `mods`: The set of virtual modifiers that were previously declared in the XKB file.
  - `ndx_rtrn`: The return value, which will contain the index of the resolved modifier.

The function first checks if the expression is an identifier and, if so, uses the `XkbModNameToIndex` function to resolve it as a virtual modifier name. If the expression is not an identifier, it returns an error.

Once the modifier has been resolved, the function returns the index of the resolved modifier in the `ndx_rtrn` argument.

Note that this function is only used when resolving virtual modifiers, and is not used for other types of expressions.
