This is the source code for a Mach-O binary plugin for Radare2. It defines a `RBinPlugin` structure that contains information about the plugin and provides functions to load and analyze Mach-O binaries, as well as some other utility functions. The `RBinPlugin` structure includes a number of fields:

* `name`: A string containing the name of the plugin. This should be a unique identifier for the plugin.
* `desc`: A string describing the plugin and its functionality.
* `license`: A string indicating the license under which the plugin is distributed.
* `get_sdb`: A function pointer to a function that returns an SDB instance containing information about the plugin's metadata.
* `load_buffer`: A function pointer to a function that loads a binary from memory and initializes its internal state.
* `destroy`: A function pointer to a function that cleans up any resources used by the plugin when it is no longer needed.
* `check_buffer`: A function pointer to a function that checks whether a given buffer contains a Mach-O binary.
* `baddr`: A function pointer to a function that returns the base address of the binary.
* `binsym`: A function pointer to a function that returns information about a symbol in the binary, such as its address and name.
* `entries`: A function pointer to a function that returns the entry point(s) of the binary.
* `signature`: A function pointer to a function that returns the signature of the binary.
* `sections`: A function pointer to a function that returns information about the sections in the binary.
* `symbols`: A function pointer to a function that returns information about the symbols in the binary, such as their names and addresses.
* `imports`: A function pointer to a function that returns information about the imports of the binary.
* `size`: A function pointer to a function that returns the size of the binary.
* `info`: A function pointer to a function that provides information about the plugin, such as its version number and author.
* `header`: An array of strings containing the names of the fields in the Mach-O header.
* `fields`: An array of strings containing the names of the fields in the Mach-O file structure.
* `libs`: A function pointer to a function that returns information about the libraries used by the binary.
* `relocs`: A function pointer to a function that returns information about the relocation entries in the binary.
* `patch_relocs`: A function pointer to a function that applies patches to the binary's relocation entries.
* `create`: A function pointer to a function that creates a new Mach-O binary from scratch, based on a given architecture and operating system.
* `classes`: A function pointer to a function that returns information about the classes defined in the binary.
* `write`: A function pointer to a function that writes a modified version of the binary back to memory or a file.

The source code includes some helper functions for parsing Mach-O binaries, such as `MACH0_(get_main)` and `MACH0_(mach_headerfields)`, which extract information from the Mach-O header and fields, respectively. It also includes an implementation of the `RBinWrite` interface, which allows the plugin to write a modified version of the binary back to memory or a file.
