 This is a C function that performs timestamp adjustment on MPEG-2 Transport Stream packets. It takes an input buffer containing the data, its size, and an offset value for the time adjustment as parameters.

The function iterates over each packet in the buffer. For each packet, it checks if there's an adaptation field present and whether it contains a PCR (Program Clock Reference) field. If so, it extracts the PCR base and extension values, performs the timestamp adjustment using the provided offset, and then writes the adjusted values back into the packet data.

Next, the function checks if the current packet is a PES (Packetized Elementary Stream) packet and whether its payload starts with a start code (0x000001). If so, it checks for the presence of PTS (Presentation Time Stamp) and DTS (Decoding Time Stamp) fields in the PES header and performs timestamp adjustment on these values as well.

The function uses helper functions to extract and rewrite timestamps in the packet data. The `ADJUST_TIMESTAMP` macro is used to apply the time offset to a given timestamp value.

Overall, this function is used to correct the timestamps of MPEG-2 Transport Stream packets, which can be useful for synchronizing playback or performing other timestamp-based operations on the data.
