 This is an example of a method that restamps the PCR values in an MPEG-2 transport stream file. It uses the `gf_m2ts_get_pts` function from GPAC to extract the PTS and DTS values, and then adjusts them using the `ADJUST_TIMESTAMP` macro.

The method is defined as a static method of the `GF_M2TSFile` class, which means that it can be called directly on an instance of this class. The method takes two arguments: `buffer`, which should contain the contents of an MPEG-2 transport stream file, and `ts_size`, which specifies the size in bytes of the buffer.

The method first reads the PCR values from the buffer using the `gf_m2ts_get_pcr` function from GPAC. It then adjusts the PCR values using the `ADJUST_TIMESTAMP` macro, which takes a single argument that specifies the number of seconds by which to adjust the timestamp.

After adjusting the PCR values, the method uses the `gf_m2ts_rewrite_pcr` function from GPAC to rewrite the PCR values in the buffer. It then reads all the packets in the buffer using the `gf_m2ts_next_packet` function from GPAC, and adjusts the PTS and DTS values for each packet that is a payload unit start indicator (PUSI) or a video access unit (VU).

Finally, the method returns the number of bytes processed in the buffer using the `done` variable.
