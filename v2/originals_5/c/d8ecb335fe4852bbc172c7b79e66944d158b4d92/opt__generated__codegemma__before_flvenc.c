**Description:**

The provided code snippet defines an `ff_flv_muxer` structure that represents the Flash Video (FLV) muxer. It handles the encoding and packaging of video and audio data into the FLV format.

**Key Functionality:**

- **Header Writing:** `flv_write_header()` initializes the FLV header, including metadata and codec configuration.
- **Packet Writing:** `flv_write_packet()` writes video and audio packets, adjusting timestamps and data as needed.
- **Trailer Writing:** `flv_write_trailer()` finalizes the FLV file with a trailer tag.

**Key Features:**

- Supports video and audio codecs: FLV1, MP3, ADPCM_SWF.
- Variable frame rate support.
- Non-strict timestamp handling.

**Code Highlights:**

- `avio_w8()` and `avio_wb32()` are used for writing data in the FLV format.
- `pkt->pts` and `pkt->dts` are used to determine the presentation and decoding timestamps.
- `flv->duration` is updated with the maximum duration of all video packets.

**Usage:**

The `ff_flv_muxer` structure can be used to create an FLV encoder by initializing an `AVOutputFormatContext` with this structure.

**Additional Notes:**

- The code is part of the FFmpeg project, an open-source multimedia framework.
- The specific codec configurations and settings may vary depending on the version of FFmpeg used.
- The `CONFIG_LIBMP3LAME` macro determines whether the MP3 codec is supported.
