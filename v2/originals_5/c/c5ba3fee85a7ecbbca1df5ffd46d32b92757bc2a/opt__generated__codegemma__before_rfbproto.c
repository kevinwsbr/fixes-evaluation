**Header Files:**

The code includes header files for various compression and image encoding algorithms, including:

- `rre.c`
- `corre.c`
- `hextile.c`
- `ultra.c`
- `zlib.c`
- `tight.c`
- `trle.c`
- `zrle.c`

**Macros:**

The code defines several macros, including:

- `GET_PIXEL32`: Used to extract pixel values from a byte buffer.
- `CONCAT2`, `CONCAT2E`, `CONCAT3`, `CONCAT3E`: Used for concatenating identifiers.
- `BPP`: Defines the bits per pixel.
- `REALBPP`: Specifies the real bits per pixel for certain algorithms.
- `UNCOMP`: Indicates the uncompressed bit depth.

**Functions:**

- `PrintPixelFormat`: Prints the pixel format information, including the number of bits per pixel, significant byte order, and color information.

**Key Features:**

The code appears to be part of a VNC client library, responsible for decoding and displaying remote desktop data. It supports various compression and image encoding algorithms to optimize data transmission and image quality.

**Additional Notes:**

- The code uses the LibVNCServer library for authentication and encryption.
- The `vncauth.c` and `d3des.c` files are included for authentication purposes.
- The code includes header files for various compression and image encoding algorithms.
- The `BPP` macro is used to set the bits per pixel, while `REALBPP` and `UNCOMP` are used to specify the real bits per pixel and uncompressed bit depth, respectively.
