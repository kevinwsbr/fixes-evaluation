This is a large C file that contains the implementation of various VNC protocols and utilities. It includes code for handling pixel formats, encryption, and authentication. The `rfbClient` prefix is added to each function name to avoid naming conflicts with the LibVNCServer library.

Here are some highlights of what you can expect in this file:

* VNC protocol implementation:
	+ Handling pixel format negotiation and encoding/decoding of pixels.
	+ Implementing various compression algorithms (e.g., ZRLE, Tight, Ultra) and supporting different bit depths.
	+ Support for true color vs. indexed color modes.
	+ Authentication using various protocols (e.g., VNC Authentication or NoAuthentication).
* DES encryption: Implementing the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm to encrypt sensitive information exchanged between the client and server during authentication.
* Utility functions: Implementing utility functions for converting pixel values, handling errors, and logging messages.
