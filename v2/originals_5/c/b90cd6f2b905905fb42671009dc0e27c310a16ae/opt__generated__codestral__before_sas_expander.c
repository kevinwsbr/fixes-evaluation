 The given code snippet is a collection of functions related to the SAS (Serial Attached SCSI) subsystem in Linux kernel. Here's a brief explanation of each function:

1. `sas_rediscover`: This function rediscovers a specific device connected to a SAS expander based on the provided `phy_id`. It checks if the given physical link is part of a wide port with another device and then calls either `sas_rediscover_dev` or `sas_discover_new` based on the result.

2. `sas_ex_revalidate_domain`: This function revalidates the entire SAS domain by finding all broadcast devices and their physical links, and then calling `sas_rediscover` for each link.

3. `sas_smp_handler`: This function handles SMP (SAS Management Protocol) requests sent to a device connected through a SAS expander. It checks if the target device is an edge or fanout expander, finds the corresponding domain device, and executes the SMP task using `smp_execute_task_sg`. If successful, it marks the job as done with the appropriate status and length received.
