**sas_ex_revalidate_domain() Function:**

- Revalidates the domain by iterating through each PHY of an expander device.
- Uses the `sas_find_bcast_phy()` function to find PHYs with broadcast addresses.
- Calls `sas_rediscover()` for each valid PHY.
- Returns 0 if successful, or an error code if any errors occur.

**sas_smp_handler() Function:**

- Processes SMP (Serial Management Protocol) requests.
- Takes the following parameters:
    - bsg_job: A pointer to the BSG (Block Storage Generic) job object.
    - shost: A pointer to the SCSI host.
    - rphy: A pointer to the SAS rphy.
- Checks if the device is an expander and if the rphy is valid.
- Finds the domain device associated with the rphy.
- Validates the number of scatter/gather lists in the request and reply.
- Executes the SMP task using `smp_execute_task_sg()`.
- Sets the length received in the BSG job object and completes the job.

**Purpose:**

The `sas_ex_revalidate_domain()` and `sas_smp_handler()` functions are part of the SAS (Serial Attached SCSI) discovery process. They work together to revalidate the domain and process SMP requests, respectively.

**Key Points:**

- The `sas_ex_revalidate_domain()` function discovers new SAS devices in the domain.
- The `sas_smp_handler()` function handles SMP requests from SAS devices.
- Both functions are critical for the proper functioning of the SAS discovery process.
