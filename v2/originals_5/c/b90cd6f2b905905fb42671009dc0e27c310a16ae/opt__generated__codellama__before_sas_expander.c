The `sas_smp_handler` function is called when an IOCTL request for an SMP command is received from a user space application. The function first checks whether the given Rphy object supports sending SMP requests by checking its device type which can be either SAS_EDGE_EXPANDER_DEVICE or SAS_FANOUT_EXPANDER_DEVICE.
If the Rphy object does not support sending SMP requests, the function returns an error and quits.
Otherwise, it uses `sas_find_dev_by_rphy` function to find the domain device associated with the given Rphy object. If there is no such device, the function prints an error message and returns an error.
The function then checks whether the request contains multiple segments or not. If it does, it prints an error message and returns an error.
Then it uses `smp_execute_task_sg` function to execute the SMP command on the domain device. The function returns the number of bytes received from the target in case of success, otherwise it returns a negative value which is treated as an error by the caller function.
Finally, if the returned value is positive, the function updates the bsg_job structure with the length received and calls `bsg_job_done` function to complete the request.
