 This is a module for the Linux kernel that provides support for USB communication with devices using the CDC NCM (Network Control Model) protocol. The `cdc_ncm` driver in this module provides an interface for networking over USB and supports various types of USB devices, including those from various vendors.

Here is a list of some of the key features provided by this module:

* Supports various types of USB devices that use the CDC NCM protocol.
* Provides an interface for networking over USB.
* Supports autosuspend and hibernation.
* Disables hub-initiated low power mode.

The `cdc_devs` array contains a list of USB device IDs supported by this module, along with information about the devices and the driver that should be used for them. The `MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE` macro is used to provide a table of supported devices, and the `usb_driver` structure is used to define the driver that will be used for each device.

This module also defines several variables and functions that are used to provide support for USB communication with devices using the CDC NCM protocol. These include the `cdc_ncm_info`, `wwan_noarp_info`, `wwan_info`, and `cdc_ncm_driver` structures and functions.

Overall, this module provides a robust and versatile set of tools for working with USB devices that use the CDC NCM protocol.
