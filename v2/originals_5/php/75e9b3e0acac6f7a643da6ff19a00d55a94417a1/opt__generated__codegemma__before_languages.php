**Purpose:**

The provided code snippet is responsible for displaying a table of sub-languages with their associated functionalities.

**Key Features:**

- Displays a list of sub-languages with their original name, English name, LMS folder, visibility status, and actions.
- Provides options to:
    - Make a sub-language available or unavailable.
    - Edit a sub-language.
    - Add terms for a sub-language.
    - Delete a sub-language.

**Functionality:**

- The code iterates through a list of sub-languages and creates a table row for each language.
- For each row, it determines the visibility status of the sub-language based on the `available` field.
- If the sub-language is visible, a "MakeUnavailable" icon is displayed.
- If the sub-language is unavailable, a "MakeAvailable" icon is displayed.
- Each row also includes links to edit the sub-language, add terms, and delete the sub-language.

**Security:**

- The code utilizes `Security::remove_XSS()` to sanitize user input before displaying it in the table.
- It also includes appropriate HTML tags for displaying icons and links.

**Additional Notes:**

- The code requires the following classes:
    - SortableTableFromArrayConfig
    - Display
    - Security
- The `get_lang()` function is assumed to be available for retrieving language strings.
- The icons used in the table are specified in the `Display::return_icon()` function.
- The `sub_language.php` and `sub_language_add.php` pages are referenced for the "AddWordForTheSubLanguage" and "DeleteSubLanguage" actions, respectively.

**Conclusion:**

The code snippet provides a comprehensive interface for managing and interacting with sub-languages, offering functionalities to control visibility, edit content, add terms, and delete language entries.
