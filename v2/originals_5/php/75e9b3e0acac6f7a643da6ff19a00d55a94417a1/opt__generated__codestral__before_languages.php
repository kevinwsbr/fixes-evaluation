 This is a PHP script that generates an HTML table to display information about languages. The table includes columns for language ID, original name, English name, LMS folder, and properties (which include actions such as making the language available or unavailable, editing the language, using sub-languages, adding terms to sub-languages, and deleting sub-languages).

Here is a breakdown of what the script does:

1. It retrieves data about languages from a database and stores it in an array called `$language_data`. This is done using a loop that iterates over each row returned by a SQL query.
2. For each language, the script determines whether certain actions are allowed based on the language's properties (e.g., whether sub-languages can be used or deleted). It then generates HTML code for these actions and stores it in variables such as `$setplatformlanguage`, `$allow_use_sub_language`, `$allow_add_term_sub_language`, and `$allow_delete_sub_language`.
3. The script creates a new instance of the `SortableTableFromArrayConfig` class, which is used to generate the HTML table. It sets the headers for each column and adds form actions such as "Make Available" and "Make Unavailable".
4. The script displays an empty div with the ID "id_content_message", which can be used to display messages to the user (e.g., confirmation messages after performing an action).
5. Finally, the script calls the `display()` method of the `SortableTableFromArrayConfig` instance to generate and output the HTML table.
6. The script ends with a call to the `Display::display_footer()` function, which generates the footer for the page.
