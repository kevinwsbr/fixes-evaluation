**Global Variables**

The code snippet you provided defines several global variables used throughout the MantisBT application. These variables control various settings, including logging, JavaScript optimization, database connections, and more.

**Key Global Variables:**

* **$g_log_level:** Determines the level of logging, ranging from LOG_NONE (no logging) to LOG_CRIT (critical errors).
* **$g_log_destination:** Specifies the destination for logging messages, such as a file or a database.
* **$g_minimal_jscss:** Indicates whether JavaScript files should be compressed using YUI Compressor (ON) or not (OFF).
* **$g_global_settings:** Contains a list of settings that should be loaded from the database but are stored as global variables for performance optimization.
* **$g_mantistouch_url:** Specifies the URL for MantisTouch redirection, with the %s placeholder for the MantisBT path.

**Configuration Settings:**

The code also defines a configuration setting for the MantisTouch URL, which determines where users are redirected when accessing MantisBT via MantisTouch.

**Temporary Variables:**

The code includes some temporary variables used during initialization but are then immediately unset to avoid unnecessary memory usage.

**Purpose:**

The global variables and configuration settings defined in this code snippet are essential for initializing and configuring the MantisBT application. They allow developers to control various aspects of the application's behavior, such as logging, performance, and user experience.

**Additional Notes:**

* The `LOG_NONE` constant indicates that no logging is enabled.
* The `ON` and `OFF` constants are used to represent boolean values.
* The `file://` protocol is used for file-based logging, while `database:` could be used for database-based logging.
* The `error_log` function is used for logging in PHP.
* The `$g_path` variable is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code.
