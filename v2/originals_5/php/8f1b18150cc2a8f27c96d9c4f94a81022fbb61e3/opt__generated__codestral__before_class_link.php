 This is a PHP class called `class_link` that provides methods for generating and manipulating links in a web application. Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities:

1. **Generate Link**: The `getLinkHref` method generates a URL based on the provided parameters, such as page ID (internal and external), action, language, parameters, system ID, and anchor. It constructs the URL by concatenating these components with appropriate separators and encoding.

2. **Generate Portal Link**: The `getLinkPortalHref` method generates a portal-specific link based on similar parameters. If multiple portal languages are available, it appends the language parameter to the URL; otherwise, it removes any language parameter from the URL.

3. **Generate Popup Link**: The `getLinkPortalPopup` method creates a JavaScript function that opens a new window or popup with the generated portal link when clicked. It takes additional parameters for the title and size of the popup window.

4. **Parse Parameters**: The `parseParamsString` method is an internal helper function that parses a string of URL parameters into an associative array, extracting the system ID if present.

5. **Determine Number of Portal Languages**: The `getIntNumberOfPortalLanguages` and `getStrPortalLanguage` methods are used to determine the number of available portal languages and fetch the current portal language, respectively. These values are cached for subsequent use to improve performance.
