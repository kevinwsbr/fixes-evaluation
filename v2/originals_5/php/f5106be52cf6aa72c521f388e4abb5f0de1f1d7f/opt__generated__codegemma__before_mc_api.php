**Error Handling in PHP**

The provided PHP code implements an error handling mechanism for a SOAP service. Here's a breakdown of the code:

**Error Handling Function:**

* The `error_handler()` function catches any errors encountered in the script.
* It extracts the error type, description, and stack trace.
* It formats the error information into a SOAP fault and sends it as a response.

**Stack Trace Function:**

* The `error_get_stack_trace()` function generates a stack trace of the function calls leading to the error.
* It supports both PHP's built-in debug functions and Xdebug for more detailed information.

**SOAP Fault Functions:**

* `mci_soap_fault_login_failed()` creates a SOAP fault indicating an access denied due to incorrect login credentials.
* `mci_soap_fault_access_denied()` creates a SOAP fault indicating an access denied due to insufficient permissions.

**Error Handling Process:**

1. The `error_handler()` function is registered as the default error handler.
2. Any errors encountered in the script will trigger the `error_handler()` function.
3. The function formats the error information into a SOAP fault.
4. The SOAP fault is sent as a response.

**Key Features:**

* Custom SOAP faults for specific error scenarios.
* Detailed stack trace for debugging purposes.
* Support for both PHP's built-in debug functions and Xdebug.

**Usage:**

The code can be used to handle errors in a SOAP service by registering the `error_handler()` function. When an error occurs, the function will automatically generate a SOAP fault and send it as a response.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code assumes that the `$l_oServer` object is available and can be used to send SOAP responses.
* The `user_get_name()` function is assumed to be available for retrieving the user name based on the user ID.
* The `error_build_parameter_string()` function is not shown in the code but is assumed to be available for formatting error parameters.
