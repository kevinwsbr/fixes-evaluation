This code is part of the OpenEXR library, and it defines a class called `MultiPartInputFile` that represents an input file containing multiple parts. The class has several data members:

* `_is`: A pointer to an `IStream`, which is used for reading the file's contents.
* `_data`: A pointer to an instance of the `Data` class, which contains additional information about the file and its parts.
* `_version`: An integer that represents the version number of the OpenEXR file format.
* `_header`: A vector of `Header` objects, each representing a part in the file.
* `_chunkOffsetTableSize`: An integer that represents the size of the chunk offset table for each part.

The class has several member functions:

* `MultiPartInputFile(IStream *is)`: Constructs an instance of the `MultiPartInputFile` class from a given `IStream`.
* `version() const`: Returns the version number of the OpenEXR file format used in the input file.
* `parts() const`: Returns the number of parts in the input file.
* `partComplete(int part) const`: Returns `true` if the specified part is complete, and `false` otherwise.
* `readChunkOffsetTables()`: Reads the chunk offset tables for each part in the file.
* `getPart(int i)`: Returns a pointer to the `InputPartData` object corresponding to the specified part number.

The class also has several private data members and functions that are not listed here.
