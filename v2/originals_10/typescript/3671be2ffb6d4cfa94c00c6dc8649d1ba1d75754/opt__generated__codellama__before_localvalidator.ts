  This class provides a simple validation service for SLP (Simple Ledger Protocol) transactions. It caches the validation results for each transaction to speed up repeated validations. The `validateSlpTransactions` method takes an array of transaction IDs and returns an array with only the valid ones. If a transaction is not in the cache, it will be validated using the Bitcoin Core JSON RPC API and the result added to the cache.

The class has several methods:

* `isValidSlpTxid(txid)`: Validates a single SLP transaction ID and returns `true` if the transaction is valid, or `false` otherwise. The method uses the cached validation results for previous calls if possible to speed up repeated validations.
* `validateSlpTransactions(txids)`: Validates an array of SLP transaction IDs and returns an array with only the valid ones. Each element in the returned array is either a string containing the valid transaction ID or an empty string if the corresponding transaction was invalid.

The `cachedValidations` field is used to store the cached validation results for previous calls to `isValidSlpTxid`. The class uses a dictionary with transaction IDs as keys and validation result objects as values. The validation result object contains the following fields:

* `validity`: A boolean value indicating whether the transaction is valid (true) or not (false).
* `waiting`: A boolean value indicating whether the validation is still in progress (true) or has already completed (false).
* `invalidReason`: A string containing a description of why the transaction is invalid, if it is not valid.
* `parents`: An array of parent transactions for the current transaction, each represented by an object with the following fields:
  * `txid`: The ID of the parent transaction.
  * `valid`: A boolean value indicating whether the parent transaction is valid (true) or not (false).
  * `inputQty`: The quantity of inputs in the parent transaction, represented as a BigNumber object.
  * `outputQty`: The quantity of outputs in the parent transaction, represented as a BigNumber object.
* `details`: An object containing additional details about the current transaction, including:
  * `transactionType`: A string indicating the type of transaction (MINT, SEND, or GENESIS).
  * `versionType`: A string indicating the version type of the transaction (token version or NFT version).

The class also uses several helper methods for validation, such as `checkTokenInputsAreGreaterThanOutputs`, which checks that token inputs are greater than token outputs, and `checkValidInputsAreGreaterThanTokenOutputs`, which checks that valid inputs are greater than token outputs. These methods use the cached validation results to speed up repeated validations.

The class also handles MINT transactions with no valid input by checking for a valid baton parent, and it checks versionType is not different from valid parents.
