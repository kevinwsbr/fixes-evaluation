 This Java code is part of a Subversion source control management (SCM) implementation, specifically the `SubversionSCM` class. The code includes methods for handling SCM polling, network timeouts, and SVN authentication comparisons. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Network Timeout**: The `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT` constant is used to prevent infinite hang during SCM operations. It defaults to one hour (3600 seconds) but can be configured via the system property "SubversionSCM.timeout".

2. **Polling Configuration**: The `POLL_FROM_MASTER` boolean variable determines whether SCM polling should happen from the master or slave in a distributed system. It's set based on the boolean value of the system property "SubversionSCM.pollFromMaster".

3. **Configuration Directory**: If the `CONFIG_DIR` static field is set to a non-null value, it overrides the default Subversion configuration directory ("~/.subversion") for reading configuration settings.

4. **SSH Debugging**: The `enableSshDebug(Level level)` method allows enabling trace logging of the Ganymed SSH library at a specified log level (default is FINEST). This can be useful for debugging SSH-related issues.

5. **SVN Authentication Comparison**: The `compareSVNAuthentications(SVNAuthentication a1, SVNAuthentication a2)` method compares two instances of `SVNAuthentication` for equality by describing their properties and comparing the descriptions. This is useful in situations where SVN authentication objects need to be compared without referencing their memory addresses directly.

6. **Revision Extraction**: The private `getRevisionFromRemoteUrl(String remoteUrlPossiblyWithRevision)` method extracts the revision number from a given URL if it's specified in the format "URL@REVISION". It returns an instance of `SVNRevision` representing the extracted revision or null if no revision is present in the URL.
