 This code snippet appears to be part of a larger application or library that manages and interacts with extensions, likely within a web browser or similar environment. The purpose of the provided code is to handle extension management, including loading, enabling, disabling, and reloading extensions based on certain conditions and settings. Below, I'll explain each function and its role in the overall system:

1. **`loadExtension(extension)`**: This function attempts to load an extension by importing it from the provided `extension` object. It checks if the extension has an `init` method, calls it if available, and assigns the result to `extensionState`. If no `init` method is found or if there's an error during initialization, it logs the error.

2. **`getEnabledExtensions()`**: This function retrieves a list of enabled extensions. It first checks the session mode settings for any explicitly defined enabled extensions and then merges them with those that are part of the user-defined settings (if allowed by global settings).

3. **`onEnabledExtensionsChanged()`**: This function is triggered when the enabled extensions have changed, either through addition or removal. It filters out UUIDs that were previously disabled but are now enabled, and vice versa, updating the extension state accordingly.

4. **`_onVersionValidationChanged()`**: When version validation settings change, this function handles re-enabling extensions based on new permissions from `Main.sessionMode.allowExtensions`. It temporarily disables all extensions before potentially re-enabling some or all of them depending on session mode settings.

5. **`_loadExtensions()`**: This function sets up signal connections to monitor changes in the enabled and disabled extension settings, then initializes an ExtensionFinder to detect and load new extensions found during scanning.

6. **`enableAllExtensions()`**: This function enables all detected extensions if they are not already enabled. If extensions have not been initialized yet (`initted` is false), it does so by calling `_loadExtensions()`.

7. **`disableAllExtensions()`**: This function disables all currently enabled extensions, reversing the process of enabling them. It's used to quickly turn off all extensions when needed, such as during updates or significant system changes.

8. **`_sessionUpdated()`**: This function responds to session mode updates by adjusting the state of extensions based on whether they are allowed (`Main.sessionMode.allowExtensions`) or not. If allowed, it ensures that extensions are either enabled or disabled according to their UUIDs in `enabledExtensions`.

9. **`init()`**: This is a setup function that initializes the extension management system by connecting to session mode updates and setting up internal state based on current settings. It calls `_sessionUpdated()` to ensure proper initialization of extensions.

These functions together form a robust mechanism for managing and controlling how extensions are loaded, enabled, disabled, and updated within an application or environment where they might be used as plugins or add-ons.
