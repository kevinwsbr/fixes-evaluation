**Description:**

The code snippet provides the kernel registration for TensorFlow operations related to quantizing and dequantizing data. It includes kernels for both CPU and GPU devices.

**Kernel Registration:**

* **CPU Kernels:**
    * `QuantizeAndDequantizeV2Op`: Performs quantization and dequantization with the minimum and maximum values.
    * `QuantizeAndDequantizeV3Op`: Similar to `V2Op` but allows specifying the number of bits for quantization.
    * `QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Op`: Performs quantization and dequantization without requiring minimum and maximum values.
    * `QuantizeAndDequantizeV4GradientOp`: Calculates gradients for the quantized and dequantized data.
    * `QuantizeAndDequantizeOp`: A general operation that supports both quantizing and dequantizing.

* **GPU Kernels:**
    * Similar to the CPU kernels, but they are optimized for GPU devices.

**Kernel Arguments:**

* `input`: Input data to be quantized or dequantized.
* `input_min`: Minimum value of the input data.
* `input_max`: Maximum value of the input data.
* `input_backprop`: Gradient of the input data.
* `input_min_backprop`: Gradient of the minimum value.
* `input_max_backprop`: Gradient of the maximum value.
* `num_bits`: Number of bits used for quantization.

**Usage:**

These kernels can be used in TensorFlow operations to perform quantization and dequantization of data. The specific kernel to use depends on the device (CPU or GPU) and the desired quantization settings.

**Note:**

* The `REGISTER_CPU_KERNEL` and `REGISTER_GPU_KERNEL` macros are used to register the kernel builders for each device.
* The `T` template parameter specifies the data type (float or double).
* The `HostMemory` attribute is used to specify that certain arguments are stored in host memory.
