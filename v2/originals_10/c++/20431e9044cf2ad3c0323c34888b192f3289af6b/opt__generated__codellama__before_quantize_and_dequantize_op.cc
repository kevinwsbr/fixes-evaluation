 This is a header file for the QuantizeAndDequantizeOp in TensorFlow.

The file contains several functions and classes that are used to define and implement the QuantizeAndDequantizeOp. These include:

* `QuantizeAndDequantizeOp`: The main class for the QuantizeAndDequantizeOp, which defines the computation performed by the op. It takes in a tensor of floating-point values, as well as two scalars representing the minimum and maximum values that can be represented by the output.
* `QuantizeAndDequantizeV2Op`: A specialization of the QuantizeAndDequantizeOp for when the input and output types are the same (i.e., floating-point).
* `QuantizeAndDequantizeV3Op`: A more general version of the QuantizeAndDequantizeOp that allows for a variable number of bits to be used for quantization.
* `QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Op`: Another specialization of the QuantizeAndDequantizeOp for when the input and output types are the same, and uses the same number of bits for quantization as in the previous version.
* `QuantizeAndDequantizeGradientOp`: The gradient operation for the QuantizeAndDequantizeOp, which computes the gradients of the op with respect to its inputs.
* `QuantizeAndDequantizeV4GradientOp`: A specialization of the GradientOp for when the input and output types are the same (i.e., floating-point).

The file also contains several macros that are used to register the op with TensorFlow, including:

* `REGISTER_CPU_KERNEL`: Registers the QuantizeAndDequantizeOp for use on CPU devices.
* `REGISTER_GPU_KERNEL`: Registers the QuantizeAndDequantizeOp for use on GPU devices (if CUDA or ROCm is being used).

These macros are defined using a combination of TensorFlow's C++ template metaprogramming and its `REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER` macro, which allows you to define kernels that can be called by the system.
