 This code registers several TensorFlow kernels for the QuantizeAndDequantizeV2, QuantizeAndDequantizeV3, QuantizeAndDequantizeV4, and QuantizeAndDequantize operations. These kernels are registered for both CPU and GPU devices, and for float and double data types.

The first block of code defines two macros: `REGISTER_CPU_KERNEL` and `TF_CALL_*`. The `REGISTER_CPU_KERNEL` macro registers the specified kernel for a given data type on the CPU device. The `TF_CALL_*` macros are used to call this macro for float and double data types.

The second block of code defines another macro: `REGISTER_GPU_KERNEL`. This macro does the same thing as `REGISTER_CPU_KERNEL`, but it registers the kernel on the GPU device instead. This block is only compiled if CUDA or ROCm is enabled, which are libraries used for accelerating TensorFlow computations on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, respectively.

Finally, the last two lines of code call these macros to register the kernels for the QuantizeAndDequantize operations with float and double data types.
