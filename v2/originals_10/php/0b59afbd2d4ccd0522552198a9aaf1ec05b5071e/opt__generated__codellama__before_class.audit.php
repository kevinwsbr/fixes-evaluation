  This is a model class for the `AuditLog` table in InvoicePlane. It provides methods for logging events, as well as retrieving and formatting log entries. The class is responsible for creating and updating database records for audit logs.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. The class definition starts with `class AuditLog extends Model`. This is a standard way to define a model class in InvoicePlane.
2. The constructor method is defined as `public function __construct($vars=array())`. This sets up the model with any passed-in variables and defines some default values for the object's properties.
3. The `create()` method is defined as `static function create($vars=array())`. This method creates a new audit log record in the database based on the passed-in variables. It sets the timestamp property to the current date and time using the `SqlFunction::NOW()` method.
4. The `autoCreateTable()` method is defined as `static function autoCreateTable()`. This method checks if the `AuditLog` table already exists in the database, and if not, it creates the table and adds default events for logging different types of actions.
5. The `auditEvent()` method is defined as `static function auditEvent($event_id, $object, $info)`. This method logs an event based on the passed-in variables. It checks if the `$object` parameter is a string or an object, and if it's an object, it retrieves the relevant data from the database using the `AuditEntry::getDataById()` method. If the `$object` parameter is not an object, it sets the `data` property to the JSON-encoded version of the `$object` variable.
6. The `getEvents()` method is defined as `static function getEvents($page=1, $limit=20)`. This method retrieves a list of audit logs from the database based on the passed-in page number and limit. It uses the `db_query()` method to execute an SQL query that selects the relevant data from the `AuditLog` table.
7. The `getEventTypes()` method is defined as `static function getEventTypes()`. This method retrieves a list of available event types for logging actions in the database. It uses the `db_query()` method to execute an SQL query that selects the relevant data from the `Event` table.
8. The `deleteEvent()` method is defined as `static function deleteEvent($event_id)`. This method deletes a single audit log entry based on the passed-in event ID. It uses the `db_query()` method to execute an SQL query that deletes the relevant data from the `AuditLog` table.
9. The `deleteEvents()` method is defined as `static function deleteEvents($object=array())`. This method deletes multiple audit log entries based on a passed-in array of event IDs or objects. It loops through the array and calls the `deleteEvent()` method for each item in the array.
10. The `formatEvents()` method is defined as `static function formatEvents($events, $start=0, $end=20)`. This method formats a list of audit log entries based on the passed-in start and end indices. It loops through the list of events and calls the `formatEvent()` method for each item in the list.
11. The `formatEvent()` method is defined as `static function formatEvent($event)`. This method formats a single audit log entry based on the passed-in event. It retrieves the relevant data from the database using the `AuditEntry::getDataById()` method and formats it into an array of columns that can be displayed in a table or other visualization.
12. The `formatEventType()` method is defined as `static function formatEventType($event_id)`. This method formats a single event type based on the passed-in event ID. It retrieves the relevant data from the database using the `Event::getById()` method and formats it into an array of columns that can be displayed in a table or other visualization.
13. The `__toString()` magic method is defined as `public function __toString()`. This method returns a string representation of the audit log object, which is used when outputting the object to a string or when casting the object to a string. It formats the event data using the `formatEvent()` method and returns the resulting string.
