 This is a PHP class definition for an Audit Log system. The class is named `Audit`. It has methods to create, store and retrieve audit logs based on events occurring in the system.

   The `audit` method is used to log an event. It takes three parameters: `$event_id`, `$object`, and `$info`. It first checks if the object exists. If it doesn't, it retrieves data using the provided ID and encodes it as JSON. Then, it calls the `auditEvent` method to store the log in the database.

   The `create` method is used to create a new audit log entry. It takes an optional array of variables as input and sets the timestamp for the event to the current time.

   The `autoCreateTable` method checks if the audit table exists in the database. If it doesn't, it creates the table with columns for `id`, `object_type`, `object_id`, `event_id`, `staff_id`, `user_id`, `data`, `ip`, and `timestamp`. It also adds certain event types to the `event` table if they don't already exist.

   Overall, this class provides functionality for creating an audit log system that can track events in a database and retrieve information about those events as needed.
