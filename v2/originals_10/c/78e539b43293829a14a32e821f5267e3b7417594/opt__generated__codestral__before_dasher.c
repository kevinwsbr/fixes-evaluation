 This is a source code for a filter in the GPAC (General Purpose Audio and Video Coding) library. The filter, named "dasher", is responsible for creating Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) content from input media files. It allows encryption of content using specified Digital Rights Management (DRM) files, segmentation of the output into individual segments, and multiplexing of the segments if required.

   The filter uses the GPAC library to perform various tasks such as parsing input media files, encrypting content, generating DASH manifests, and multiplexing segments. It supports multiple encryption methods and formats, including Common Encryption (CENC), Envelope Encryption (EME), and PlayReady.

   The filter accepts a variety of command-line options to control its behavior, such as specifying input files, output directory, DRM configuration file, target duration for each segment, and fragmentation settings. It also supports the use of external tools to generate encryption keys and encryption information.

   The filter sends downstream events to indicate the size of each segment and index, which can be used by other filters in the pipeline to perform further processing or outputting. It also adds specific properties to the output PIDs to identify the DASH mode, target duration, and fragmentation settings.

   Overall, this filter provides a flexible and powerful solution for creating DASH content from input media files, with support for encryption, segmentation, and multiplexing.
