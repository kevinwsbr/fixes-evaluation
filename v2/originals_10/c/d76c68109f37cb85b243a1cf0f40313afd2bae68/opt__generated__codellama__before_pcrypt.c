  This is a kernel module for parallel encryption and decryption using the PA-DATA (PAssive Data) framework. The module creates two padata instances, one for encryption and one for decryption, and initializes them with the same parameters as the original crypto instance. It then registers the two padata instances under the "pcrypt" alias in the kernel's crypto API.

The `pcrypt_create` function is called by the kernel when a new instance of the pcrypt module is created. The function initializes the padata instances, sets up a workqueue for parallel processing, and registers a notifier callback to handle CPU mask changes. It also adds a sysfs entry to the kernel's crypto API interface.

The `pcrypt_fini_padata` function is called by the kernel when an instance of the pcrypt module is destroyed. The function frees the workqueue, unregisters the notifier callback and sysfs entries, and frees the padata instances.

The `pcrypt_init` function is called during module initialization to create the two padata instances and register them under the "pcrypt" alias in the kernel's crypto API interface. The `pcrypt_exit` function is called during module termination to destroy the two padata instances and unregister them from the kernel's crypto API interface.

Note: This is a simplified version of the code, it does not include all the error handling and other details that are present in the original code.
