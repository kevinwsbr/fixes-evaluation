 This code is a part of the SWTPM (Software TPM) project which is a software implementation of Trusted Platform Module (TPM). The function `SWTPM_NVRAM_PrintJson()` prints JSON output containing information about the state blobs in the NVRAM (Non-Volatile Random Access Memory).

   Here's an explanation of what the code does:

   1. It initializes the NVRAM using `SWTPM_NVRAM_Init()`. This function sets up the necessary resources for accessing and manipulating the NVRAM.

   2. It defines an array `states` containing the names of the state blobs that need to be checked - "permall", "volatilestate", and "savestate".

   3. It initializes a string `state_str` to store the JSON output for each state blob.

   4. It obtains the backend URI using `tpmstate_get_backend_uri()`. This function returns the URI of the backend storage used by the TPM for storing and retrieving state blobs.

   5. It iterates through each state in the `states` array and checks if a blob with that name exists in the NVRAM using `g_nvram_backend_ops->check_state()`. This function takes the backend URI, state name, and a pointer to store the size of the blob as arguments. If the blob exists, it returns TPM_SUCCESS.

   6. If the blob exists, it appends its name and size to the `state_str` string in JSON format.

   7. After iterating through all state blobs, it prints the final JSON output with the type "swtpm" and a list of state blobs along with their names and sizes.

   The function returns 0 if successful and -1 otherwise.
