**Code Functionality:**

The code snippet you provided implements a function called `xdata_encode` that is responsible for encoding xdata (extended data) in a DWG file. The function takes an object (`_obj`) as input and performs the following steps:

- Reads xdata records from the object.
- Encodes the xdata values using bitwise operations.
- Logs the encoded xdata values for debugging purposes.

**Algorithm:**

The `xdata_encode` function iterates through each xdata record in the object. For each record, it performs the following steps:

- Checks the data type of the record.
- Encodes the value using the appropriate bitwise operation (e.g., `bit_write_RL`, `bit_write_RLL`).
- Logs the encoded value using the `LOG_TRACE` macro.

**Bitwise Encoding:**

The `bit_write_*` functions are used to encode the xdata values in a bitwise manner. These functions handle different data types, such as integers, points, and binary data.

**Logging:**

The `LOG_TRACE` macro is used to log the encoded xdata values for debugging purposes. The logs include the index of the xdata record, the encoded value, and the data type.

**Errors:**

The function handles invalid group codes in the xdata and returns an error code if encountered.

**Key Features:**

- Bitwise encoding of xdata values.
- Logging of encoded values for debugging.
- Handling of different xdata data types.
- Error handling for invalid group codes.

**Usage:**

The `xdata_encode` function is typically called during the DWG file encoding process. It is responsible for encoding the xdata data for the object.

The code snippet includes macros and functions that are not defined in the provided context. These may be part of a larger codebase or library.
