**Purpose:**

The code snippet you provided is a Java class called `AjpReadListener` that handles incoming HTTP requests in an Undertow web server. It is responsible for reading raw messages from the client, buffering them, and sending them to the underlying server.

**Functionality:**

- **startRequest() method:**
   - Calculates the total size of the raw messages.
   - Allocates a ByteBuffer with the calculated size.
   - Reads the raw messages into the ByteBuffer.
   - Sends the ByteBuffer content to the underlying server channel.
   - Listens for write events on the channel and resumes writes if necessary.

- **exchangeComplete() method:**
   - Checks if the request is persistent or an upgrade request.
   - If persistent, it calls `startRequest()` and sets up the read listener.
   - If not persistent, it closes the connection.

- **createSourceConduit() method:**
   - Creates a `StreamSourceConduit` that reads data from the underlying server channel.
   - Determines the content length based on the `Transfer-Encoding` header or `Content-Length` header.
   - Creates an `AjpServerRequestConduit` that handles the request and communicates with the underlying server.
   - Returns an `EmptyStreamSourceConduit` if no content is expected.

**Key Features:**

- Buffering of raw messages before sending them to the server.
- Handling of different content length scenarios.
- Setting up a read listener for the underlying server channel.
- Terminating the request when the content is sent or an error occurs.

**Usage:**

The `AjpReadListener` class is used in conjunction with the `AjpHandler` class to handle HTTP requests using the AJP protocol. It reads incoming requests, buffers their content, and forwards them to the underlying server.

**Conclusion:**

The `AjpReadListener` class provides a mechanism for handling HTTP requests in an Undertow web server using the AJP protocol. It buffers raw messages, determines content length, and forwards the request to the underlying server.
