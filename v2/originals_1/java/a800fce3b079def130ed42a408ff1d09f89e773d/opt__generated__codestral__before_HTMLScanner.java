 The provided code is a Java class named `HTMLScanner`. This class appears to be part of an XML or HTML parsing library, as it deals with entities and buffers for reading data. Here's a summary of the main components and methods:

1. `readPreservingBufferContent()`: This method reads a single character from the current entity while preserving the content of the buffer. It handles the debugging output if needed.

2. `endCommentAvailable()`: This private method checks whether the end comment "->" is available in the data stream, loading further data if necessary without resetting the buffer.

3. `reduceToContent(final XMLStringBuffer buffer, final String startMarker, final String endMarker)`: This static method reduces the content of the provided buffer to the content between the specified start and end markers when only whitespaces are found before the start marker as well as after the end marker.

4. `for.ch`, `buffer.length-l`, `l`: These appear to be variables or expressions used in a comment, but their meaning is unclear without additional context.
