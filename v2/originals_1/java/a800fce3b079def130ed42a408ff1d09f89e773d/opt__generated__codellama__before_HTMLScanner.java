The `HTMLScanner` class is a utility class used to scan an input stream for HTML content. It provides methods to read characters, detect the end of comments, and reduce the buffer to the content between start and end markers when only whitespace characters are found before and after the markers.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

* `HTMLScanner` class: This is the main class that contains the methods for reading characters, detecting the end of comments, and reducing the buffer to the content between start and end markers.
* `read()` method: This method reads a single character from the input stream, while preserving the old buffer content. It uses the `fCurrentEntity` field to keep track of the current entity being read and the `fCurrentEntity.load(fCurrentEntity.length)` method to load more data into the buffer if necessary.
* `readPreservingBufferContent()` method: This method reads a single character from the input stream, while preserving the old buffer content. It is used by the `read()` method to read characters when the buffer is empty.
* `endCommentAvailable()` method: This method checks whether the end comment `--> `is available in the input stream. It does this by checking for the presence of three or more consecutive carets (`-`) at the end of the buffer, followed by a greater than sign (`>`). If the end comment is not found, it restores the position of the buffer to its original state before returning `false`.
* `reduceToContent()` method: This method reduces the buffer to the content between start and end markers when only whitespace characters are found before and after the markers. It does this by searching for the start marker in the buffer, then looking for the end marker from the current position. If the end marker is not found, it returns without modifying the buffer.

Overall, the `HTMLScanner` class provides a way to scan an input stream for HTML content and manipulate the buffer as needed to extract only the relevant information.
