 This is a PHP script that creates an HTML form for filtering data. The form allows the user to specify search criteria, such as date range, status, and text search. The form also includes options for selecting the view type of the results (grid or table). The script uses various functions from other files in the application to generate the form elements and handle the filtering logic.
