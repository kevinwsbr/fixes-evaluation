The `UploadException` class is used to handle errors that may occur during the upload process. It extends the built-in `Exception` class and provides a message for each error code in the `codeToMessage()` method. The `UPLOAD_ERR_*` constants are defined in the PHP `upload.php` file, and they correspond to the possible error codes that can be returned by the `$_FILES` superglobal when an upload is attempted.

The exception is thrown when an upload attempt fails due to an error code being returned. The message associated with the error code is then used as the exception's message. For example, if the `UPLOAD_ERR_NO_FILE` constant is returned, the exception will have a message indicating that no file was uploaded.

In addition to handling errors related to uploading files, this PHP script also includes some logic for resizing images that are uploaded. This functionality can be disabled by setting the `RESIZE_IMAGES` constant to `false`. If the image is too large, it will be automatically resized down to a smaller size using the GD library. The new image is then saved in place of the original file, and its metadata (such as the dimensions) are updated accordingly.

Overall, this PHP script provides a basic implementation for handling file uploads with PHP, including support for error handling and image resizing.
