 This code snippet is a part of a PHP script that handles file uploads and image processing. It includes several functions for checking the type of uploaded files, resizing images if necessary, and returning appropriate JSON responses. Here's a breakdown of what each section does:

1. **Error Handling**: The script starts by defining an `UploadException` class to handle specific upload errors. This is useful for managing error codes in PHP during file uploads.

2. **Image Processing**:
   - It checks if the uploaded file is an image using `getimagesize()` and verifies its type with `exif_imagetype()`. If it's not an image, it throws an exception.
   - If the file is an image, it resizes the image to fit within a specified maximum size (1024x768 pixels in this context) using the GD library. The script supports PNG and JPEG formats for images.
   - After processing, it saves the resized image as either PNG or JPEG depending on its original format.

3. **Logging and Cleanup**:
   - Logs are deleted based on specific conditions related to system status, uploader, and session ID.
   - The script prepares a response array `$rerturn` with details about the uploaded file's path, name, size, etc., which is then encoded into JSON format and returned as a response.

4. **Headers**: Several HTTP headers are set to prevent caching of the response, ensuring that each request gets fresh data from the server.

5. **Response**: The script outputs the `$rerturn` array in JSON format using `json_encode()`. This is crucial for any client-server interactions where JavaScript running on a browser might need to interpret this data.

6. **Shutdown Procedures**: If user session information exists, it closes the session which helps free up system resources and ensures security by invalidating sessions that are inactive for some time.

7. **Class Definition**: The `UploadException` class is defined to provide a custom error message based on specific PHP upload errors. This can be used in other parts of the script where file uploads might need to be validated more strictly.

This script effectively handles image uploads, including automatic resizing and appropriate formatting, while also managing potential errors through exception handling. The JSON response format is ideal for APIs or AJAX applications where JavaScript on a client-side application might parse this data dynamically.
