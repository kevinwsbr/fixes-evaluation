 The PHP script you've provided is a collection of methods designed to handle various tasks related to data extraction, encoding into XML format, and date formatting. These methods are part of a larger system, likely an extension or module for eZ Publish (now known as eZ Platform), which is a content management system developed by the Finnish company eZ Systems.

Here's a breakdown of what each method does:

1. **parseContentAttributes()**: This method parses attributes from a content object, specifically extracting data types that are not blacklisted and handling image-related data types separately. It returns an array structured for XML output where applicable, including details about the attribute type and content.

2. **xmlEncode()**: Converts a multi-level associative array into a valid XML string using `XMLWriter`. This method is used to serialize complex data structures into XML format which can be useful for various integrations or exports.

3. **xmlWrite()**: A recursive function that helps in converting an array into XML elements. It supports nested arrays and automatically handles numeric keys by defaulting to a child element name unless specified otherwise. This method is called internally by `xmlEncode`.

4. **formatLocaleDate()**: Formats a given timestamp according to the locale settings of the system, which can be used for displaying dates in various user-friendly formats depending on the chosen format type (e.g., time, date, datetime).

These methods are useful for developers who need to manipulate content attributes, convert data structures into XML, or handle localized date and time formatting within a eZ Publish environment. The script is well-commented, making it easier to understand how each function contributes to the overall functionality.
