 The provided code is a class that contains several static methods. Here's a brief explanation of each method:

1. `prepareObjectAttributes($object, $params)`: This function prepares object attributes for further processing or display. It takes an eZPublish Object and an array of parameters as input. The function iterates over all the attributes of the given object, and based on the provided data types and blacklist, it creates a new attribute array that is returned as part of the result array.
2. `xmlEncode($hash, $childName = 'child')`: This function converts an associative array or hash into XML format. It takes an input hash and an optional child name as parameters, and it uses the XMLWriter class to generate the XML output. The output is returned as a string.
3. `xmlWrite(XMLWriter $xml, $hash, $childName = 'child')`: This is a helper function called by xmlEncode. It takes an XMLWriter object, an input hash, and an optional child name as parameters, and it recursively writes the elements of the hash into the XML document.
4. `formatLocaleDate($timestamp, $type)`: This function formats a date timestamp according to the currently used locale code. The function takes a Unix timestamp and a type parameter (which can be "time", "shorttime", "date", "shortdate", "datetime", or "shortdatetime") as input. It uses the eZLocale class to format the date based on the provided type, and it returns the formatted date string.

The code appears to be part of a larger system that handles object attributes and data conversion between different formats. The methods in this class are likely used by other parts of the system to prepare and display object data, convert data into XML format, and format dates based on user preferences.
