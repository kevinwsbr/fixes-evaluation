This is a code snippet for the `getProductDiscount` method in a `CartService` class. It retrieves the discount for a product based on its setup price and any applicable promotions. The method takes two arguments: `$cartProduct`, which is an instance of the `Model_CartProduct` class representing the product to get the discount for, and `$setup`, which is the setup price of the product.

The method first retrieves the cart that the product belongs to by loading the `Model_Cart` model with the ID of the cart associated with the product. It then retrieves any applicable promotions for the cart using the `getRelatedDiscount` method from the same class.

The method checks if there are any promotions applied to the product and, if so, retrieves the discount for the product by calling the `getItemPromoDiscount` method with the product and promotion as arguments. If the promo has the `freesetup` flag set, it also sets the discount for the setup price to the same value as the discount for the product.

The method then returns an array containing two elements: `$discount_price`, which is the discount for the product, and `$discount_setup`, which is the discount for the setup price. If there are no promotions applied or if the promo does not have the `freesetup` flag set, then the discounts will be 0.
