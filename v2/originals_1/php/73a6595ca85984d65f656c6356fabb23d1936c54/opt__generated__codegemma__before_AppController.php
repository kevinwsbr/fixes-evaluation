**User Authentication and Login Process**

The provided PHP code snippet handles user authentication and login functionality. It uses a combination of cookies and a user database to store authentication information.

**Authentication Flow:**

1. The `userAuth()` method attempts to authenticate the user based on the provided credentials (nick and password).
    - If the nick is empty, it checks for a valid cookie.
    - It loads the user from the database based on the provided nick or cookie value.
    - If the user is found and enabled, it verifies the password and logkey (if using cookies).
    - If authentication succeeds, the user object is returned.
    - If authentication fails, `false` is returned.

2. The `cookieAuth()` method handles cookie-based authentication.
    - It extracts the cookie values for `fsNick` and `fsLogkey`.
    - It loads the user from the database based on the `fsNick` cookie value.
    - If the user is found and the logkey matches the cookie value, the user object is returned.
    - If any step fails, `false` is returned.

3. The `updateCookies()` method updates user cookies with the latest activity information and logkey.

**Login Process:**

- The user submits a login form with their credentials (nick and password).
- The `userAuth()` method is called to authenticate the user.
- If authentication succeeds, the user is redirected to the home page or a designated success page.
- If authentication fails, an error message is displayed.

**Logout Process:**

- The user clicks a logout button or performs a specific action.
- The `userLogout()` method is called to clear the user cookies.
- The user is redirected to the login page or a designated logout page.

**Key Features:**

- Cookie-based and password-based authentication.
- User activity tracking and cookie updates.
- Error handling and logging.
- Context setting for logging and error handling.

**Additional Notes:**

- The code uses the `ToolBox` library for IP filtering and logging.
- The `FS_COOKIES_EXPIRE` constant defines the expiration time for user cookies.
- The `USER_UPDATE_ACTIVITY_PERIOD` constant specifies the interval for updating user activity cookies.
- The `User` model extends the base `User` model and provides additional functionality.
