 This script appears to be a part of the PhpMyAdmin project, which is an open-source tool written in PHP for managing databases using a web interface. Here's a brief overview of what the code does:

1. It first checks if certain constants are defined and includes necessary files based on these conditions.
2. If there's no token mismatch or it's not an AJAX request, it loads user preferences from the configuration.
3. The script then removes sensitive values from the session for security reasons.
4. It checks if the current request is an AJAX request and sets a global variable accordingly. If it's an AJAX request, it suppresses headers, footers, and unnecessary output.
5. The script performs some security checks such as protecting against possible exploits and checking for GLOBALS overwrite attempts.
6. It also includes subform target pages based on certain conditions.
7. If Zero configuration mode is enabled, the script checks for PhpMyAdmin tables in the current database and fixes them if needed.
8. Finally, it includes a page settings class file.
