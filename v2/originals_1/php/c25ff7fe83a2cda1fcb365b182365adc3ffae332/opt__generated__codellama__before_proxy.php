This is a PHP script that downloads the contents of a URL and returns them to the client. It uses the cURL library to retrieve the data from the specified URL, and then sends the retrieved data back to the client using the HTTP response header.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. First, it checks if the WebGL Proxy is disabled and exits with an error message if that's the case.
2. Next, it checks if the proxy cache is enabled and creates a table called `lmproxyfiles` in the specified cache schema if it doesn't already exist. This table will be used to store files retrieved by the proxy.
3. The script then checks if there's a file matching the requested URL in the cache. If there is, it retrieves that file from the cache and sends it back to the client using the appropriate HTTP response header.
4. If there's no match in the cache, the script proceeds to download the contents of the URL using cURL. It then checks if there was an error during the download process, and if there was, it inserts a log entry with the error code and exits with an HTTP response code of 404 (Not Found).
5. If there wasn't an error, the script saves the retrieved data to the cache (if enabled) and then sends it back to the client using the appropriate HTTP response header.
6. Finally, the script logs the request (if enabled) with the appropriate status code (OK or HTTP Error) and size of the returned data.
