The class also contains some utility methods for determining the browser type and checking the brute force protection of the login form.

Here is a list of functions in this class:

1. `__construct()`: The constructor method is used to initialize the controller with necessary dependencies, such as the `AdminUser` service, the `EventDispatcherInterface`, and the `Config` service.
2. `loginAction()`: This function handles the user login action by checking the provided username and password against the stored credentials in the database. If the credentials are valid, it creates a new session for the user and redirects them to the dashboard page. Otherwise, it renders the login page with an error message.
3. `logoutAction()`: This function handles the user logout action by destroying the current session and redirecting the user to the login page.
4. `isAllowedDomain(): bool`: This function checks if the current domain is allowed for the login process. If not, it returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.
5. `detectBrowser(): bool`: This function detects the browser type and version using the `Browser` class from the `BrowserDetection` library. It then checks if the detected browser is supported by Pimcore, which means that its version must be greater than or equal to a certain minimum version. If the browser is not supported, it returns false. Otherwise, it returns true.
6. `buildLoginPageViewParams(Config $config): array`: This function builds an array of view parameters for rendering the login page. It includes the `Config` object and some CSS paths loaded by plugins.
7. `twoFactorAuthenticationAction(Request $request, ?BruteforceProtectionHandler $bruteforceProtectionHandler, Config $config)`: This function handles the two-factor authentication action for the user. If a session is available and the brute force protection handler is not null, it checks the user's username against the stored entries in the brute force protection table. Otherwise, it renders the two-factor authentication page with an error message.
8. `twoFactorAuthenticationVerifyAction(Request $request)`: This function handles the verification of the two-factor authentication code entered by the user. It is not implemented yet and should be added in the future.

These functions provide a basic implementation for handling user login and logout actions, as well as some utility methods for detecting the browser type and checking the brute force protection of the login form.
