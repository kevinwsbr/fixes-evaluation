 The provided code is a function that handles file uploading in PHP. Here's a summary of what it does:

1. It checks the file extension against a blacklist to ensure that no malicious files are being uploaded.
2. If the file extension is allowed, it further checks if the second-to-last extension is also allowed.
3. If both extensions are allowed, it performs an additional check to verify the MIME type of the file. This is done using the `finfo_open` function, which determines the content type based on the file's data rather than its extension.
4. If the MIME type indicates that the file is a PHP script or HTML document, the upload is rejected.
5. The file is then moved to its target directory with appropriate permissions.
6. The function returns 1 if the upload was successful and -1 otherwise.
