  This is a custom form that allows users to configure proxy settings for the client application. The form consists of three fields:

1. `proxy_status`: A checkbox that enables or disables the use of a proxy server.
2. `proxy_host`: A text input field where users can enter the hostname or IP address of the proxy server.
3. `proxy_port`: A text input field where users can enter the port number of the proxy server.

The form also includes two command buttons: "save" and "cancel". The "save" button saves the proxy settings to the client application, while the "cancel" button discards any changes made to the form and returns the user to the previous page.

When the "save" button is clicked, the `saveProxy()` method is called, which checks the validity of the form inputs and saves the new proxy settings to the client application if they are valid. If there are any errors, an error message is displayed and the form is re-rendered with the original values.

Note that this custom form requires the `ilTextInputGUI` class to be used for creating the text input fields, which is a part of the Innomatic project.
