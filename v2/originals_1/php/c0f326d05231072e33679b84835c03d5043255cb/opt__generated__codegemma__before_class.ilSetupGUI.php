**Functionalities:**

The code snippet you provided implements the functionalities of a user interface (UI) for a setup module. The module allows users to configure proxy settings.

**Key Features:**

- **Proxy Status:** Users can enable or disable proxy usage.
- **Proxy Host:** Users can enter the proxy server address.
- **Proxy Port:** Users can specify the port number for the proxy server.
- **Save and Cancel Buttons:** Users can save their settings or cancel the configuration process.

**Workflow:**

1. The user opens the setup module.
2. The `displayProxy()` method is called to display the proxy configuration form.
3. The user can enter their proxy settings in the form.
4. When the user clicks the "Save" button, the `saveProxy()` method is called to save the settings.
5. The setup module displays a success message and updates the proxy status.

**Key Methods:**

- `initProxyForm()`: Creates the proxy configuration form.
- `saveProxy()`: Saves the proxy settings entered by the user.
- `displayProxy()`: Displays the proxy configuration form.

**Additional Notes:**

- The code uses the `ilPropertyFormGUI` class to create the form.
- The `ilUtil` class is used to display success and failure messages.
- The `setup` object is assumed to be available in the global scope.

**Usage:**

To use the setup module, simply include the `ilSetupGUI` class in your code and call the `displayProxy()` method.
