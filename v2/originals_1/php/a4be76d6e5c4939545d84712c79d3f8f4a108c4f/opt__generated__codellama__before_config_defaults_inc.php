This is a configuration file for MantisBT, which is a bug tracking system. It contains several variables that define various settings and behaviors of the system.

Here's a brief explanation of each variable:

* `$g_webservice_readwrite_access_level_threshold`: This variable defines the minimum access level required to perform read/write operations on MantisBT through its web services. The possible values for this variable are defined by the `access_levels` table in the MantisBT database, and include REPORTER, MANAGER, DEVELOPER, TESTER, and ADMINISTRATOR.
* `$g_webservice_admin_access_level_threshold`: This variable defines the minimum access level required to perform administrator-level operations on MantisBT through its web services. The possible values for this variable are the same as for `$g_webservice_readwrite_access_level_threshold`.
* `$g_webservice_specify_reporter_on_add_access_level_threshold`: This variable defines the minimum access level required to specify a reporter name when adding an issue through its web services. If the user does not have this access level, their own name will be used as the reporter for the new issue.
* `$g_webservice_priority_enum_default_when_not_found`, `$g_webservice_severity_enum_default_when_not_found`, `$g_webservice_status_enum_default_when_not_found`, `$g_webservice_resolution_enum_default_when_not_found`, and `$g_webservice_projection_enum_default_when_not_found`: These variables define the default values to be used when a web service receives an enum label that is not defined in the associated MantisBT installation. The possible values for these variables are the same as for `$g_webservice_readwrite_access_level_threshold`.
* `$g_webservice_error_when_version_not_found`: This variable defines whether a SoapException should be raised if the specified version is not found when performing an operation on MantisBT through its web services. If set to ON, a SoapException will be raised, while if set to OFF, no exception will be raised and the default value for `$g_webservice_version_when_not_found` will be used instead.
* `$g_webservice_version_when_not_found`: This variable defines the default version to be used when a web service receives an invalid or non-existent version number. The possible values for this variable are defined by the `versions` table in the MantisBT database, and include any valid versions that have been created for the project.

Overall, these variables define various settings and behaviors of MantisBT's web services, and can be used to control access to and modify data stored within the system.
