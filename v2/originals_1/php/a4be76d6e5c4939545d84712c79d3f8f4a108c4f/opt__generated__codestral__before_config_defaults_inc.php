 These are all configuration options used for webservices in MantisBT, an open-source issue tracking system. The variables control access levels to the webservices, default enum values when not found and error handling. Here's a summary:

1. `$g_webservice_readwrite_access_level_threshold`: This sets the minimum global access level required to read or write data through the webservices. By default, it's set to REPORTER.
2. `$g_webservice_admin_access_level_threshold`: This sets the minimum global access level required to use the administrator webservices. By default, it's set to MANAGER.
3. `$g_webservice_specify_reporter_on_add_access_level_threshold`: This sets the minimum project access level needed for users to specify a reporter name when adding an issue through the webservices. If not met, the current user is used as the default reporter. By default, it's set to DEVELOPER.
4. The next few variables (`$g_webservice_priority_enum_default_when_not_found`, `$g_webservice_severity_enum_default_when_not_found`, etc.) control the enum id that is used when the webservices receive undefined enum labels, which are not defined in the associated MantisBT installation.
5. `$g_webservice_error_when_version_not_found`: If this is ON and a specified version is not found, then a SoapException will be raised. By default, it's set to ON.
6. `$g_webservice_version_when_not_found`: This sets the default version to use if the specified version is not found and `$g_webservice_error_when_version_not_found == OFF`. Currently, this value does not depend on the project. By default, it's set to an empty string.
