 This is a PHP code that defines the layout for a filter form table. It contains several classes and functions to handle the rendering of the HTML output needed for displaying the filter form in a specific layout.

The main function `filter_box_print` generates the HTML for the filter form table using several helper functions and classes defined in this code. The filter box is divided into different sections, each containing multiple fields for filtering data. Each section is represented by an instance of the `TableFieldsSection` class, which consists of multiple `TableFieldsItem` objects.

The layout of the filter form table is handled by a custom grid layout implemented in the `FilterBoxGridLayout` class, which extends the base `TableGridLayout` class. This custom layout overrides several methods to print HTML code for the table cells representing different elements of the filter form, such as field headers and content.

The code also defines a helper function `get_field_header`, which generates an HTML string for the header of a field in the filter form. The header may contain additional text or elements, such as tooltips or help icons.

Overall, this code handles the rendering of the HTML output needed to display a filter form table with a specific layout and appearance, using various classes and helper functions to handle different aspects of the rendering process.
