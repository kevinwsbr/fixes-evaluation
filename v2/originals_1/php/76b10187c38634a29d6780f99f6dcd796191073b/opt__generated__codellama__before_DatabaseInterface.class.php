The `PMA\Server` class provides a way to manage connections to MySQL servers. It is used by phpMyAdmin to connect to the database server and perform various operations such as listing databases, tables, and columns. The class also contains methods for retrieving information about the server, such as the version of the server and the number of rows in a table.

The `getLink()` method returns the link object associated with the current database connection. This link is used to execute SQL queries on the server. The `getServerPort()` and `getServerSocket()` methods return the port and socket for the server, respectively. The `isAmazonRds()` method checks if the server is running on Amazon RDS.

The class also contains methods for retrieving information about databases, tables, and columns. These methods are used by phpMyAdmin to populate the navigation tree with database and table names.

Finally, the `getKillQuery()` method returns a query that can be used to kill a specified process. This is useful when killing long-running queries in the Query window.
