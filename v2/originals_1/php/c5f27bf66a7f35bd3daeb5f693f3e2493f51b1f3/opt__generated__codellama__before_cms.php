This is a PHP class that provides some utility functions for working with strings and URLs. Here's a breakdown of the code:

* The `urlify` function takes in a string and returns a URL-suitable version of it by removing any non-alphanumeric characters, converting all accented letters to their ASCII equivalents, and replacing spaces with hyphens. This function is used for generating SEO-friendly URLs.
* The `replaceInternalPageLinks` function replaces relative roots in a URL (i.e. `{wwwroot}`) with hard links. This function is used for replacing all instances of `{wwwroot}` in a string with the actual value of the `WWW_ROOT` constant.
* The `replaceRelativeRoots` function does the same thing as `replaceInternalPageLinks`, but for multiple relative roots in a string (e.g. `{adminroot}`, `{wwwroot}`, etc.). This function is used to replace all instances of multiple relative roots in a string with their corresponding hard links.
* The `getInternalPageLink` function returns the hard link for a given internal page URL. This function is used by the `replaceInternalPageLinks` and `replaceRelativeRoots` functions to generate hard links for internal pages.

Overall, this class provides some useful functionality for working with URLs and strings in PHP.
