 This is a PHP class that contains methods for handling Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality using the SAML2 protocol. Here's a brief explanation of what each method does:

1. `buildResponseAssertion`: This method builds an assertion for a SAML2 response message. It generates attributes based on the SP and IdP metadata, sets up name identifiers, and creates an authentication statement with session not-on-or-after values. If encryption is enabled in the metadata, it encrypts the assertion using the specified key.

2. `buildLogoutRequest`: This method constructs a SAML2 logout request message based on information from the SP and IdP metadata. It sets properties like relay state, session index, name identifier, not-on-or-after value, and encrypts the name identifier if encryption is enabled in the metadata.

3. `buildResponse`: This method generates a SAML2 response message object based on information from the SP and IdP metadata. It sets properties like issuer and destination URL, and signs the response message if signing is enabled in the metadata.
