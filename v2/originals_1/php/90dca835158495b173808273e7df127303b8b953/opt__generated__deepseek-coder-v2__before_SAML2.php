 The provided code snippet appears to be a part of a larger PHP script that handles various SAML-related operations within a software system. This particular segment is focused on building and managing different types of SAML messages, such as assertions and logout requests, based on the metadata provided by an IdP (Identity Provider) and SP (Service Provider). The code snippet uses classes from the `SimpleSAMLphp` library to handle these operations. Here's a breakdown of what each function in this segment does:

1. **buildEncryptedAssertion()**: This function is responsible for encrypting a SAML assertion using either a shared key or a public key extracted from an SP's metadata. It checks if encryption is enabled and then proceeds to either use the provided shared key or retrieve a public key from the metadata, which it subsequently uses to encrypt the assertion.

2. **buildLogoutRequest()**: This function constructs a SAML Logout Request message based on the metadata of both the IdP and SP. It sets up the logout request with necessary details such as session index, name ID, and assertion lifetime, considering settings from both metadata sources. Additionally, it determines whether to encrypt the NameID based on metadata settings.

3. **buildResponse()**: This function constructs a SAML Response message for authentication purposes. It decides whether to sign the response based on SP-defined preferences, defaulting to IdP settings if not explicitly set by the SP. The function sets the issuer of the response and adds a signature if required.

These functions are part of a larger system designed to facilitate secure communication between an IdP and multiple SPs using SAML for authentication and session management. Each function encapsulates specific aspects of handling SAML messages, ensuring that metadata-driven configurations can be respected during these interactions.
