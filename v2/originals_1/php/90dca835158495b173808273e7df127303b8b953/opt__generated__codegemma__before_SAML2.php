**Purpose:**

The code snippet you provided implements a set of functions for processing SAML assertions and creating SAML messages in a SimpleSAML framework.

**Key Functions:**

* `start_L2_Assertion()`: Encrypts an assertion based on the configuration of the SP and IdP.
* `buildLogoutRequest()`: Creates a logout request message based on the SP and IdP metadata.
* `buildResponse()`: Creates an authentication response message based on the SP and IdP metadata.

**Functionality:**

* **Assertion Encryption:**
    * Reads the `assertion.encryption` setting from both SP and IdP metadata.
    * Uses a shared key or public key to encrypt the assertion if encryption is enabled.
    * Returns an encrypted assertion object.
* **Logout Request:**
    * Builds a logout request message with the session index, name ID, and relay state.
    * Sets the validity period based on the assertion lifetime setting.
    * Encrypts the name ID if encryption is enabled.
* **Authentication Response:**
    * Creates a SAML 2.0 response message.
    * Sets the issuer and destination.
    * Signs the response if configured.

**Usage:**

These functions are used internally by the SimpleSAML framework to process SAML assertions and create SAML messages. They are not intended to be called directly by application developers.

**Code Structure:**

* The functions are defined within a class with the `_` prefix, indicating that they are internal helpers.
* The functions take metadata configurations and additional parameters as input.
* They use the SimpleSAML library and XMLSecurityKey class for SAML message creation and encryption.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code assumes the presence of SimpleSAML configuration and metadata.
* The specific configuration options used can vary depending on the environment.
* The code is written in PHP and uses the SimpleSAML library.
