 It seems like you've shared a portion of PHP code with me. This code includes several functions that perform different tasks such as handling conditional expressions, breaking tags based on a wraptag, and creating hashes for given strings.

Let's break down the functionality:

1. `txp_cond()`: This function evaluates a condition based on the provided operator and returns true or false accordingly. It can handle various operators like '==', '<', '>', '<=', '>=', 'exact', 'any', 'all', and 'pattern'.
2. `txp_break()`: This function determines which tag to break based on the input wraptag. For instance, if the wraptag is 'ul' or 'ol', it returns 'li'; for 'p', it returns 'br'; and so on.
3. `txp_hash()`: This function generates a hash for a given string using a specific hashing algorithm (defined by TEXTPATTERN_HASH_ALGO) if the length of the string exceeds TEXTPATTERN_HASH_LENGTH. If not, it returns the original string as is.

Additionally, there's an `array_column` polyfill included in case you are using a PHP version that doesn't natively support this function.
