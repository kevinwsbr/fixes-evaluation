 This code is a part of an uploader function in a PHP-based application, specifically for the administration section. It's designed to handle file uploads and perform several checks to ensure security and validity of the files.

Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. **File Extension Check**: The code checks the file extension against a blacklist of forbidden extensions (`$blacklist_extensions`). It allows for multiple extensions in a filename by splitting the filename at each period and checking each segment. If any of these segments are found in the blacklist, it sets `$isForbidden` to true.

2. **MIME Type Check**: If the file extension check doesn't flag the file as forbidden, the code further checks the MIME type of the file using PHP's `finfo_open` function. If the MIME type is "text/x-php" or "text/html", it returns -1 and stops the upload process.

3. **File Movement**: After all checks are passed, the code moves the uploaded file to its target directory (which depends on whether the file is an image). It also sets the correct permissions for the new file.

4. **Success Check**: The success of the file movement operation is stored in `$success`. If any error occurs during this process, `$success` will be false, and this information is passed back to the application.
