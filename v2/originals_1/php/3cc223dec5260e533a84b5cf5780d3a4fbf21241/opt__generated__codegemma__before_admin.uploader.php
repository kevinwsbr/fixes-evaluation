**Description:**

The code snippet you provided is a PHP function that handles file uploads in a web application. It checks for forbidden extensions and MIME types to prevent malicious files from being uploaded.

**Functionality:**

- The function accepts an array of uploaded files as input.
- It iterates through each file and performs the following checks:
    - Counts the number of extensions in the file name.
    - Checks if the last two extensions are in a predefined list of forbidden extensions.
    - Uses the `finfo` extension to determine the MIME type of the file.
    - If the MIME type is "text/x-php" or "text/html", the function returns an error.
    - Moves the uploaded file to the appropriate directory based on the file extension.
- If all files are uploaded successfully, the function returns `1`. Otherwise, it returns `-1`.

**Blacklisted Extensions:**

The function uses a predefined list of forbidden extensions, which includes:

- php
- php3
- php4
- php5
- php6
- phtml
- html
- js
- txt
- cgi
- cgi
- pl

**MIME Type Check:**

The function uses the `finfo` extension to determine the MIME type of each uploaded file. If the MIME type is "text/x-php" or "text/html", the function returns an error.

**Directory Assignment:**

The function assigns the appropriate directory based on the file extension:

- If the file extension is an image extension (jpg, png, gif), the directory is `IMAGES_DIR`.

**Security Considerations:**

- The function does not perform any input validation on the file names or extensions. This could potentially allow attackers to upload malicious files with arbitrary filenames.
- The function does not check for file size limits or upload quotas.

**Improvements:**

- Implement input validation on file names and extensions.
- Add support for additional MIME types.
- Implement file size limits and quotas.

**Conclusion:**

The code snippet provides a basic mechanism for file upload security, but it is important to implement additional security measures to protect against malicious uploads.
