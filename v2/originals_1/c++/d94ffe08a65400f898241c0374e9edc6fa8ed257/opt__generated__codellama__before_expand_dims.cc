This code snippet defines a TensorFlow Lite operation that expands the dimensions of an input tensor by inserting a new dimension at a specified position. The `Prepare` function checks if the output size is known, and if not, it sets the output to dynamic size using the `SetTensorToDynamic` function from `tensor_ctypes.h`. Then, in the `Eval` function, if the output is still dynamic, it uses the `GetAxisValueFromTensor` function to get the value of the axis tensor, and then calls the `ExpandTensorDim` function to expand the dimensions of the input tensor. Finally, the `Eval` function copies the data from the input tensor to the output tensor.

To fix the out-of-bounds read vulnerability, you should change the line that reads:
