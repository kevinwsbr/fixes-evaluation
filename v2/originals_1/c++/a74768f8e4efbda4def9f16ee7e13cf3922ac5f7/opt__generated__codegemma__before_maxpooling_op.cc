I understand that the code you provided is a C++ code snippet that contains the following functionalities:

**Forward Declarations:**
- It defines a template class `SpatialMaxPooling` for GPU devices with different data types.
- It declares the `operator()` method for each data type specialization.

**Registration of GPU Kernel:**
- It registers kernel builders for different data types (float, double, etc.) and different kernel functions.
- It specifies the device as GPU and the type constraint for each kernel.

**Note:**
- The code uses the `GOOGLE_CUDA` and `TENSORFLOW_USE_ROCM` macros to determine if the code is compiled for CUDA or ROCM.
- It also includes the necessary header files for GPU operations.

**Additional Notes:**
- The code defines kernel builders for different pooling operations (MaxPool, MaxPoolV2, MaxPoolGradGradWithArgmax).
- It also includes a comment about the possibility of re-enabling specific kernels once the underlying build error is fixed.

**Overall, the code sets up the necessary GPU kernels for performing spatial max pooling operations.**
