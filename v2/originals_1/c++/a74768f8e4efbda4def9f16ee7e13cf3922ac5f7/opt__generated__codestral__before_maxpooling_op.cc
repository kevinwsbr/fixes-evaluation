 This code is a part of the TensorFlow library, which provides an open-source software framework for machine learning. The code you've shared is responsible for registering different types of max pooling kernels for various devices (CPU and GPU) and data types (numeric and quantized integer).

The max pooling operation is a common operation in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), where it reduces the spatial dimensions of the input while keeping the most important information. There are two main variants of max pooling used here: MaxPoolingOp and MaxPoolingV2Op, which correspond to different versions or implementations of the same operation.

The code starts by defining a macro called DECLARE_GPU_SPEC that declares a template struct for spatial max pooling operations using Eigen's GpuDevice (which is TensorFlow's abstraction for GPU computation). This struct is then instantiated for all the supported GPU data types using the TF_CALL_GPU_NUMBER_TYPES macro.

Next, the code defines another macro called REGISTER_MAX_POOL_KERNELS that registers kernels for max pooling operations on a specific device and data type. This is done by calling the REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER function with the appropriate parameters. The different types of max pooling kernels are registered using this macro, which includes both CPU and GPU devices (if CUDA or ROCM support is enabled) for numeric and quantized integer data types.

The code also registers some kernels that are only implemented for the GPU device. These include variants of MaxPoolingOp and MaxPoolingV2Op that do not use a mask, as well as a kernel for computing gradient gradients with argmax.
