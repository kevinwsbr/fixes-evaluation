 The code you've provided is a class `DNS` with methods to handle DNS events, add resolver classes, and clean up resolvers. It also has a nested class `Resolver` which seems to be used for processing socket read events related to DNS resolution.

In the `HandleEvent` method, it fetches the result of a DNS query and checks if the request ID is valid. If the ID is not -1, it proceeds to check if it's an error reply or not. If it's an error, it masks off the error bit and marshals the error to the correct class. If it's not an error, it marshals the result to the correct class.

The `AddResolverClass` method is used to add a derived `Resolver` object to the working set. It checks if the pointer and ID of the resolver are valid. If they are, it checks if the slot for that ID is already occupied. If not, it sets up the pointer to the class.

The `CleanResolvers` method is used to clean up resolvers when a module is unloading. It iterates through all possible request IDs and deletes any resolver objects that were created by the specified module.
