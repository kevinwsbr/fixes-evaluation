 The provided code snippet appears to be part of a larger software project related to DNS resolution. It includes several classes and methods for handling DNS requests, errors, and results within the context of a module system in a server application. Below is an explanation of each component and its role within this system:

### `Resolver` Class
- **Purpose**: This class represents a resolver that handles DNS queries.
- **Methods**:
  - `~Resolver()`: Destructor, which currently does nothing but may be extended in future versions.
  - `OnError(ResolverError, const std::string&)`: Method to handle errors during DNS resolution; currently a placeholder.
  - `GetId()`: Returns the request ID associated with this resolver instance.
  - `GetCreator()`: Returns the module that created this resolver instance.

### `DNS` Class
- **Purpose**: This class handles DNS events and results, including caching and error handling.
- **Methods**:
  - `HandleEvent(EventType, int)`: Method to process socket read events related to DNS queries.
  - `GetResult()`: Retrieves the result of a DNS query.
  - `GetCache(const char*)`: Retrieves cached results for a given domain name.
  - `AddResolverClass(Resolver*)`: Adds a resolver class to the working set, ensuring it does not already exist in the cache.
  - `CleanResolvers(Module*)`: Clears all resolvers associated with a specific module during its unload.

### Helper Structures and Constants
- **DNSResult**: A struct used for encapsulating DNS query results, including ID, original query string, result data, and TTL.
- **ERROR_MASK**: A constant used to identify error replies in the DNS response.
- **Classes[]**: An array of `Resolver*` pointers, where each index corresponds to a unique request ID. This is used for managing active resolvers.

### Logics and Flow:
1. **DNS Request Handling**: When a DNS query is made using a resolver instance (`Resolver`), it gets an ID assigned by the system. The `Classes[]` array maps this ID to the specific resolver instance, allowing for easy retrieval of results when the response arrives or errors occur.
2. **Error Handling**: If there's an error during the DNS resolution (e.g., a timeout or server failure), the method `OnError` is called with appropriate error codes and messages. The system also logs these events for debugging purposes using ServerInstance->Logs->Log.
3. **Result Processing**: Upon receiving a response, the `HandleEvent` method processes it:
   - If there's an error in the DNS reply (indicated by the ERROR_MASK), it marks the request as failed and notifies the appropriate module via `OnError`. The resolver instance is then removed from the cache.
   - For successful responses, if caching is enabled (`GetCache` returns NULL), results are cached using the original query string as the key. The corresponding resolver instance is notified of the lookup completion with the result data and TTL.
4. **Module Cleanup**: When a module is being unloaded (e.g., through a `CleanResolvers(Module*)` call), all resolvers associated with that module are invalidated, and they notify their parent modules about the forceful unload via `OnError`.

### Summary:
The code provides a robust framework for handling DNS queries within a modular server application, including error management, result caching, and dynamic cleanup of resources when modules are unloaded. Each resolver is uniquely identified by an ID, which allows efficient tracking and lifecycle management of DNS requests across the system.
