**Resolver Class:**

The provided code defines a `Resolver` class that handles DNS requests. It provides the following functionalities:

- Keeps track of a unique request ID (`myid`).
- Implements a `GetId()` method to retrieve the request ID.
- Implements an `OnError()` method to handle errors during the request process.
- Implements a `~Resolver()` destructor for cleanup.

**DNS Class:**

The `DNS` class manages the DNS request-response process. It does the following:

- Keeps track of active resolver classes in an array called `Classes`.
- Implements a `HandleEvent()` method to handle incoming DNS responses.
- Implements an `AddResolverClass()` method to add new resolver classes to the set.
- Implements a `CleanResolvers()` method to remove resolver classes associated with a specific module.

**Key Features:**

- **Request ID Management:** Each resolver class gets a unique request ID, which is used to track the request and send responses.
- **Error Handling:** The `OnError()` method handles errors during the request process.
- **Event Handling:** The `HandleEvent()` method handles incoming DNS responses and updates the corresponding resolver classes.
- **Caching:** The `DNS` class maintains a cache of previously resolved DNS entries.
- **Module Integration:** The `CleanResolvers()` method allows modules to unload their associated resolver classes when they are unloaded.

**Usage:**

To use the `Resolver` class, you would first create an instance of the `Resolver` class and call the `AddResolverClass()` method to add it to the `DNS` class. When a DNS request is made, the `DNS` class will handle it and invoke the `OnLookupComplete()` method of the corresponding resolver class once the response is received.

**Additional Notes:**

- The `ERROR_MASK` constant is used to mask the error bit in the DNS response.
- The `CachedQuery` structure is used to store cached DNS entries.
- The `statsDns`, `statsDnsGood`, and `statsDnsBad` variables are used to track statistics related to DNS requests.
