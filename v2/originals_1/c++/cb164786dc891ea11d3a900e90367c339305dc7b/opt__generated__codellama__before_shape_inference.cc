This code defines a class `InferenceContext` that is used to perform shape inference on a TensorFlow graph. It has a number of methods for adding information about the shapes and types of tensors, as well as for querying this information.

The `InferenceContext` class stores two lists: one for the handles of all the input tensors, and one for the handles of all the output tensors. Each handle represents a tensor with a specific shape and type. The shapes and types are stored in the form of `std::vector<ShapeAndType>`, which is a vector of structs containing the shape and type of each tensor.

The `InferenceContext` class also has a number of methods for merging and relaxing information about tensors. For example, the `MergeInputHandleShapesAndTypes` method takes two lists of shapes and types, and returns a new list where any compatible shapes or types are combined. The `RelaxOutputHandleShapesAndMergeTypes` method takes a list of shapes and types and relaxes them to unknown shapes, while still allowing compatible shapes and types to be merged in.

The class also has methods for querying information about tensors, such as the shape of an output tensor given its index.

Overall, this code defines a flexible framework for performing shape inference on TensorFlow graphs, which can be used to generate more informative error messages or to optimize performance by skipping redundant computations based on the shapes and types of tensors.
