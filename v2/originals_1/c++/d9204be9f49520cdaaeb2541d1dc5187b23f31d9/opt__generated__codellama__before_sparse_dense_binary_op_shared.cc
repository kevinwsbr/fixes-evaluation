This code defines a family of kernel functions for performing binary operations (such as multiplication, division, and addition) on sparse tensors. The kernels are parameterized by the type `T` of the values in the sparse tensor, and use the functor class `functor::mul`, `functor::div`, or `functor::add` depending on the operation being performed.

The kernel function first retrieves the dense side of the sparse tensor using the `dense_t->shaped<T, NDIM>(b.y_reshape())` method. It then broadcasts this dense tensor to match the shape of the indices using the `broadcast` method. The `idx` variable is an Eigen array of size `NDIM` that stores the index values for each element in the sparse tensor.

The kernel function then loops over each non-zero element in the sparse tensor, retrieves the corresponding value from the dense side using the `coeff` method, and applies the binary operation to it. The result is stored in a new dense Eigen array called `dense_gathered_flat`.

Finally, the kernel function copies the values of `values_t->flat<T>()` into a new dense Eigen array using the `device(ctx->eigen_device<Device>())` method. The resulting tensor is then returned as the output of the kernel function.

The `REGISTER_KERNELS` macro is used to register the kernels for each supported data type `T`.
