 It seems like the code you've shared is a part of TensorFlow's source code, specifically for operations on sparse and dense tensors. The code defines several macros that generate kernel builders for different types of binary operations between sparse and dense tensors. These operations include multiplication (`SparseDenseCwiseMul`), division (`SparseDenseCwiseDiv`), and addition (`SparseDenseCwiseAdd`).

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. The `REGISTER_KERNELS` macro is defined to generate kernel builders for each operation. It takes a type `T` as an argument, which represents the data type of the tensors (e.g., float32 or int64).

2. For each operation, a kernel builder is registered using the `REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER` macro. This macro takes several arguments:
   - The name of the operation as a string (e.g., "SparseDenseCwiseMul").
   - The device for which the kernel should be built (in this case, CPU).
   - The type constraint for the tensors (e.g., `TypeConstraint<T>("T")`).
   - The operation class to be used for the kernel (e.g., `SparseDenseBinaryOpShared<CPUDevice, T, functor::mul<T>>`).

3. The `TF_CALL_REAL_NUMBER_TYPES(REGISTER_KERNELS);` line at the end of the code is used to expand the `REGISTER_KERNELS` macro for all real number types supported by TensorFlow (e.g., float16, float32, float64).

4. The `SparseDenseBinaryOpShared` class is a template that implements the binary operation between sparse and dense tensors. It takes three arguments: the device type, the data type of the tensors, and the functor representing the specific binary operation (e.g., multiplication, division, or addition). The implementation of this class is not shown in the code snippet provided.

5. The `functor` namespace contains various functors for different types of operations, such as multiplication (`mul`), division (`div`), and addition (`add`). These functors are used by the `SparseDenseBinaryOpShared` class to perform the desired operation on the tensors.

In summary, this code defines kernel builders for performing binary operations between sparse and dense tensors for various real number types supported by TensorFlow. The specific operation (e.g., multiplication, division, or addition) is determined by the functor passed to the `SparseDenseBinaryOpShared` class.
