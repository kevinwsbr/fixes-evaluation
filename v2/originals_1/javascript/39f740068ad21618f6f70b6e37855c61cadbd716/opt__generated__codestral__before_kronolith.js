 In the provided code, there are several functions and events defined for a web application named "Kronolith." Here's a brief explanation of each:

1. `onDomLoad`: This function is called when the DOM (Document Object Model) is fully loaded. It sets up various event listeners, such as for double-clicking, mouse wheel scrolling, and input field changes.

2. `initialize`: This function initializes the application once the page has finished loading. It sets up the calendar list, updates the sidebar events, and starts polling for new data at regular intervals.

3. Global Event Handlers: Several global event handlers are defined, such as for drag-and-drop operations, date picking, form submission/resetting, and showing notifications. These handlers are used throughout the application to manage user interactions and update the UI accordingly.

4. Extending AJAX Exception Handling: The `HordeCore.onException` function is extended to handle AJAX exceptions specifically for the "Kronolith" application. This allows for custom error handling and displaying user-friendly messages in case of errors during AJAX requests.

Overall, this code sets up a web application with various event listeners, initializes the application, and extends the core functionality to handle specific use cases within the "Kronolith" application.
