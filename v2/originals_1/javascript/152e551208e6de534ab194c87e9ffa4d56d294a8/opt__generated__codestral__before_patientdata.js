 This is a JavaScript code snippet that appears to be a part of a larger application. It defines methods for saving and deleting patient data in the application. The `saveModel` method saves the current model's data by sending an AJAX request to the server with the data as JSON. If the request is successful, it displays a success message and reloads the page or hides a dialog box. If the request fails, it displays an error message and highlights any input fields that contain errors. The `deleteModel` method sends a DELETE request to the server to delete the current model's data, and displays a success message if the request is successful.

Here are some additional notes on the code:

* It appears to use jQuery for AJAX requests and DOM manipulation.
* The `page` object is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the application and contains properties such as `patient`, `fetchParams`, and `model`.
* The `app` object is also assumed to be defined elsewhere and contains methods such as `showProgress`, `hideProgress`, `appendAlert`, and `getErrorMessage`.
* The `setTimeout` function is used to display success messages with a delay, so that they are not immediately hidden by other UI elements.
* The code includes comments that suggest it may be part of a larger application that handles patient data in a medical context. For example, there are fields for a mother's name and guardian's name, as well as checkboxes for allowing the use of immunization registry information, sharing health information with external entities, and allowing patients to access a patient portal.
