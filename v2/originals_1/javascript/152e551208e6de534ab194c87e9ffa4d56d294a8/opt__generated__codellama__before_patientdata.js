This is a snippet of code from the OpenMRS Patient Management System. It appears to be some JavaScript code that is used for saving and deleting patient records.

The code uses jQuery to perform AJAX requests to the server to save or delete patient records. It first fetches the current values of the input fields using jQuery selectors, then builds an object with those values as properties. This object is then passed as the data parameter to the `saveModel` method, which sends a POST request to the server to save the patient record.

If there are any errors during the saving process, the code will display an alert message with the error details. If the saving operation is successful, it will close the dialog box and re-fetch and render the collection of patient records if necessary.

The `deleteModel` method is similar to the `saveModel` method, but it sends a DELETE request to the server to delete the patient record instead. Again, there are error handling mechanisms in place if any errors occur during the deletion process.
