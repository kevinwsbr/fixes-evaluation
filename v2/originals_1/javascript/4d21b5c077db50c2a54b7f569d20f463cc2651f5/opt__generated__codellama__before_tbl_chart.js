This code appears to be part of a web page that allows the user to visualize data in a chart. It uses JavaScript and jQuery to handle various events related to the chart, such as changes in the title, x-axis labels, y-axis labels, and series. The code also includes some functionality for resizing the chart container and displaying error messages.

The `currentSettings` object is used to store the current configuration of the chart, including its type, width, height, x-axis label, y-axis label, title, stacking of series, main axis (the x-axis or y-axis), selected series, and series column. The `chart_data` variable stores the actual data used to generate the chart.

The code also includes a few functions for handling various events related to the chart:

* `drawChart()` is called whenever there is a change in the chart configuration (e.g., changes in the title, x-axis labels, y-axis labels, or series). It uses the `chart_data` variable to generate the chart.
* `onXAxisChange()` is called whenever the user selects a new x-axis column. It updates the `currentSettings` object with the selected x-axis column and calls `drawChart()`.
* `onDataSeriesChange()` is called whenever the user selects a new series column. It updates the `currentSettings` object with the selected series column and calls `drawChart()`.
* `checkSqlQuery()` is called when the user submits the form. It checks whether the SQL query has been entered correctly (i.e., it should return data) and returns an error message if not. If everything is okay, it updates the `chart_data` variable with the returned data from the SQL query and calls `drawChart()`.
* `PMA_ajaxShowMessage()` and `PMA_ajaxRemoveMessage()` are used to display and remove messages in the web page, respectively. They are part of the jQuery UI library.
