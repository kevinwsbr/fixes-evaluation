 Here is the explanation of each part:

1. The code listens for focus events on input elements with names `"ForTitle"` and handles them by storing the current value into a variable called `temp_chart_title`. This is likely to be used later in case the user changes their mind about what they want to set as the title of the chart.

2. The code listens for keyup events on these input elements (i.e., when the user releases a key) and updates the `currentSettings` object's title property with the new value entered by the user. It then calls the `drawChart()` function to redraw the chart with the updated settings.

3. If the input element loses focus (blur event) and the current value is different from what was initially stored in `temp_chart_title`, it assumes that the user has made a change, so it calls the `drawChart()` function to redraw the chart with the updated settings.

4. The code listens for change events on dropdown menus with names "chartXAxis", "chartSeries", "chartSeriesColumn", and "chartValueColumn". When an option is selected in any of these menus, it updates the corresponding property in the `currentSettings` object and calls the `drawChart()` function to redraw the chart with the updated settings.

5. The code listens for keyup events on input elements with names "xaxis_label" and "yaxis_label". When the user releases a key while typing into these inputs, it updates the corresponding property in the `currentSettings` object and calls the `drawChart()` function to redraw the chart with the updated settings.

6. The code listens for submit events on the form element with an ID of "tblchartform". When the user submits the form, it prevents the default form submission behavior (which would cause a page reload) and sends an AJAX POST request to the server with the form data. If the server returns JSON data indicating that the request was successful and contains chart data, the code parses the JSON data into JavaScript objects and calls the `drawChart()` function to draw the chart using the new data.

7. The code uses jQuery UI's resizable plugin to make a div element with an ID of "resizer" resizable by the user. When the size of this element changes, it updates the corresponding properties in the `currentSettings` object and calls the `drawChart()` function to redraw the chart with the updated settings.

8. The code initializes the `currentSettings` object with default values based on the current state of various form elements and other variables defined earlier in the script. It then calls two helper functions, `onXAxisChange()` and `onDataSeriesChange()`, to update some additional properties in the `currentSettings` object.

9. Finally, the code submits the form element with an ID of "tblchartform" using jQuery's submit method to initiate the AJAX POST request described above.
