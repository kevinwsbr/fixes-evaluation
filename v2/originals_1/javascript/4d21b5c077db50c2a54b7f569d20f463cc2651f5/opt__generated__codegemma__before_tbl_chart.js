**Code Functionality:**

The code snippet you provided is a JavaScript function that handles various user interactions and events related to a chart. It performs the following tasks:

**1. User Interface Interaction:**

- Handles changes in chart options such as title, axis labels, series selection, and stack series toggle.
- Updates the chart data and redraws the chart when these options are changed.

**2. Data Handling:**

- Retrieves chart data from a form submission via AJAX.
- Parses the chart data and stores it in a `chart_data` variable.

**3. Chart Initialization:**

- Sets up the initial chart settings based on user inputs and form values.
- Initializes the chart with the specified data and settings.

**4. Chart Drawing:**

- Calls a `drawChart()` function to render the chart based on the current settings and data.

**5. Event Handlers:**

- Attaches event listeners to various form elements and user interactions, including:
    - Checkboxes for stack series toggle
    - Input fields for chart title and axis labels
    - Select elements for chart options (series, x-axis, value columns)

**6. Chart Resizing:**

- Configures a resizable element with minimum dimensions.
- Adjusts the chart width and redraws it when the window is resized.

**7. AJAX Request:**

- Handles form submissions and sends an AJAX request to retrieve chart data based on the user-specified SQL query.

**Overall Function:**

The JavaScript function provides a user interface for configuring and visualizing a chart, allowing users to adjust various options such as title, labels, series selection, stack series, and data columns. It dynamically updates the chart based on user interactions and data requests.

**Additional Notes:**

- The code assumes the existence of functions and variables such as `drawChart()`, `getSelectedSeries()`, and `checkSqlQuery()`.
- The `currentSettings` object stores the current chart configuration.
- The `chart_data` variable holds the retrieved chart data.
- The `dateTimeCols` and `numericCols` arrays store the indices of date and numeric columns, respectively.
