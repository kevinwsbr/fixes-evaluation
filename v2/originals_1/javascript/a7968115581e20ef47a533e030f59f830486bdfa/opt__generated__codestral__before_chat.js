 This code is part of an implementation for a real-time chat feature in a collaborative text editor. The `init` function sets up event listeners for the chat input field and other elements on the page, while the `addChatMessage` function handles the display of new messages in the chat window. Here's a breakdown of what each section does:

1. Event listeners setup:
   - The `keydown` event listener is added to the chat input field to handle keyboard shortcuts (Alt+C or Escape) that can be used to toggle focus between the chat input and the text editor.
   - A `keypress` event listener is added to the entire document body to allow users to focus on the chat window using a keyboard shortcut (Alt+C).
   - Another `keypress` event listener is added to the chat input field to handle the Enter key being pressed, which triggers the sending of a new message.
2. Chat initialization:
   - The `init` function initializes the chat feature by setting up the necessary event listeners and resetting the chat counter to zero.
   - It also sets up a click event listener for the "Load more messages" button, which allows users to load previous chat messages from history when it is clicked.
3. Message display:
   - The `addChatMessage` function handles the display of new messages in the chat window. It takes the message object as input and performs various checks to determine how the message should be displayed (e.g., whether it contains a mention of the current user).
   - If the message contains a mention of the current user, it is marked as sticky and a notification icon is displayed in the browser tab using Tinycon.
   - The function also calls any registered hooks for chat messages to allow for custom processing or display.
   - Finally, if necessary, the chat window is scrolled down to ensure that the most recent message is visible.
