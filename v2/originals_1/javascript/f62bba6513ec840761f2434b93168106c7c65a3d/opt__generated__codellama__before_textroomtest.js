This code is part of a larger application that allows users to communicate with each other in real-time over the WebSocket protocol using the TextRoom library. It provides some helper functions and variables that are used throughout the application.

Here's a breakdown of what each function does:

* `sendMessage(message)`: This function sends a message to the server via the TextRoom library. The message is sent in the form of a JSON object with properties for the text of the message, the transaction ID, and the room name. If the message is not acknowledged by the server (i.e., if the `ack` property of the message is set to `false`), an error alert is displayed.
* `getDateString(jsonDate)`: This function takes a JSON date object as input and returns a formatted string representing the time at which the message was sent. If no date is provided, it defaults to the current time.
* `randomString(len, charSet)`: This function generates a random string of length `len` using the characters in the character set `charSet`. If no character set is provided, it defaults to the uppercase and lowercase letters of the English alphabet and the digits 0-9.
* `getQueryStringValue(name)`: This function takes a query string parameter name as input and returns its value if present. It uses regular expressions to extract the value from the URL query string. If no value is found, it returns an empty string.
* `escapeXmlTags(value)`: This function takes a string as input and returns a copy of the string with any XML tags (e.g., `<` or `>`) escaped. This is necessary because some TextRoom messages may contain XML tags that need to be escaped in order to prevent parsing issues.

Overall, these functions provide useful utilities for working with text messages and other data types in the context of a real-time chat application.
