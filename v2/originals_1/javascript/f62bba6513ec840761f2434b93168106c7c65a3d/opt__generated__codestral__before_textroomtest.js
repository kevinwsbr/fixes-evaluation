 This code is a JavaScript file that handles the functionality for a chat room application. It includes functions to join a chat room, send messages, send private messages, and handle data transmission through the DataChannel. Here's a breakdown of each function:

1. `joinRoom(room)`: Joins the specified chat room by creating a connection to a server using the WebSocket protocol. It handles various events like opening the connection, receiving data, closing the connection, and errors. The function also sends a join message to the server with the requested username and room name.

2. `sendMessage()`: Sends a chat message to the currently joined chat room. It retrieves the message from an input field, creates a message object with the required properties (transaction ID, room, text), and sends it through the DataChannel. If successful, it clears the input field.

3. `sendPrivateMsg(username)`: Sends a private message to a specific user in the chat room. It prompts the user for the recipient's username and the message content. The function creates a message object with the required properties (transaction ID, room, recipient's username, text), sends it through the DataChannel, and displays the sent message in the chatroom section of the application.

4. `sendData()`: Sends data through the DataChannel. It retrieves the data from an input field, creates a message object with the required properties (transaction ID, room, text), and sends it through the DataChannel. If successful, it clears the input field.

5. `getDateString(jsonDate)`: A helper function to format times. It takes an optional JSON date as input and returns a formatted string in the format "HH:MM:SS".

6. `randomString(len, charSet)`: A helper function to generate random usernames or transaction IDs. It generates a random string of a specified length using the provided character set (default is alphanumeric).

7. `getQueryStringValue(name)`: A helper function to parse query string parameters from the URL. It takes the name of the parameter as input and returns its value if found, or an empty string otherwise.

8. `escapeXmlTags(value)`: A helper function to escape XML tags in a given string to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
