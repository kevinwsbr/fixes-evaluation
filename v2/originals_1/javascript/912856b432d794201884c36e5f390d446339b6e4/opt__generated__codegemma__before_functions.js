- **isStorageSupported(type)**: Checks if the specified type of storage (localStorage or sessionStorage) is supported by the browser.
- **AJAX.registerTeardown()**: Unbinds event handlers before tearing down a page.
- **AJAX.registerOnload()**: Registers event handlers to be executed when the page loads.

**Event Handlers:**

- **keydown event handler on form inputs**: Handles "Ctrl/Alt + Enter" key combinations to submit forms.
- **change event handler on radio buttons**: Responds to changes in radio buttons with the name "pw_hash".

**Features:**

- Form validation
- Error handling
- Browser compatibility checks
- Event handling
- AJAX communication

**Usage:**

The JavaScript code is included in a web page and executes when the page loads. It handles user interactions and performs necessary actions based on events.

**Benefits:**

- Improved user experience
- Enhanced form functionality
- Error prevention
- Improved browser compatibility

**Limitations:**

- The code may require additional configuration or dependencies depending on the specific application context.
- The functions and event handlers may need to be adapted or extended for specific use cases.

**Additional Notes:**
