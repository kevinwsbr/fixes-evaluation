 This is a Ruby on Rails helper module that contains several methods related to user avatars, links, sanitization of anchor names, javascript tags for the layout head, favicon handling, and robot exclusion tag generation. It also includes methods for generating CSV data with proper encoding and decimal separator, and a method for extending the helper object with the correct wiki formatting helper based on the application's settings.

Here are brief explanations of some of the main methods:

1. `avatar(user, options = {})`: This method generates an avatar image tag for the given user using their email address if available or falls back to a default avatar. It allows customization through options such as size and class.
2. `avatar_edit_link(user, options = {})`: If gravatars are enabled in the settings, this method generates a link that opens Gravatar's website for the user to edit their avatar.
3. `sanitize_anchor_name(anchor)`: This method sanitizes an anchor name by removing any non-word characters and replacing whitespace with hyphens.
4. `javascript_heads`: This method generates javascript tags that are included in the layout head, such as jQuery libraries, application scripts, and a warning script if enabled for unsaved changes.
5. `favicon`, `favicon_path`, and `favicon_url`: These methods handle favicon generation and retrieval, returning the correct path or URL based on theme settings.
6. `robot_exclusion_tag`: This method generates a meta tag to prevent search engine indexing of the page.
7. `include_in_api_response?(arg)` and `api_meta(options)`: These methods handle API responses, allowing for the inclusion or exclusion of certain data based on parameters passed in the request.
8. `generate_csv`: This method generates CSV data with proper encoding and decimal separator based on application settings.
