  This is a Linux kernel module for accessing the Chrome OS embedded controller (EC). The module provides a character device that can be used to interact with the EC through the CROS_EC_DEV ioctl interface.

The module implements the following functions:

* cros_ec_dev_init: Initializes the module and registers it with the Linux kernel. This function creates a new character device and sets up its major number, minor numbers, and name. It also initializes the device class and registers the driver for the EC devices.
* ec_device_probe: Probes the EC device to determine its existence and capabilities. If the EC device is found, this function sets up the device's character device and adds it to the kernel.
* cros_ec_dev_exit: Unregisters the driver for the EC devices and frees any resources associated with the module.

The module uses the platform driver framework provided by Linux to register itself as a device driver for the EC devices. It also uses the character device framework to create a character device that can be used to interact with the EC through the CROS_EC_DEV ioctl interface.
