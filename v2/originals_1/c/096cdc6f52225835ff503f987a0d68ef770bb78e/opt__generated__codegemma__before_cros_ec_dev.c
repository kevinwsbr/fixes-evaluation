**Module Name:** cros-ec-ctl

**Purpose:**

The cros-ec-ctl module provides a userspace interface to the Chrome OS Embedded Controller (EC). It allows users to communicate with the EC and control its functions.

**Key Functions:**

* Allocates a range of minor numbers for character devices.
* Registers a platform driver for the EC device.
* Creates a class device for the EC.
* Provides an API for interacting with the EC.

**Module Initialization:**

* Registers the device class for the EC.
* Allocates a range of minor numbers for character devices.
* Registers the platform driver for the EC device.

**Module Exit:**

* Unregisters the platform driver for the EC device.
* Unallocates the range of minor numbers for character devices.
* Unregisters the device class for the EC.

**Module Interface:**

* `ec_device_probe()` function is called when a platform device is detected.
* `ec_device_remove()` function is called when a platform device is removed.

**Key Variables:**

* `cros_class`: Device class for the EC.
* `ec_major`: Major number of the character devices.
* `cdev`: Character device for the EC.
* `class_dev`: Class device for the EC.

**Module Features:**

* Supports multiple EC devices.
* Provides a /dev entry in devtmpfs.
* Offers an API for interacting with the EC.

**Module Limitations:**

* Limited to Chrome OS systems.
* Requires root privileges to access the EC.

**Module Usage:**

To use the cros-ec-ctl module, follow these steps:

1. Install the module into the kernel.
2. Import the necessary header files.
3. Create an instance of the `cros_ec_dev` struct.
4. Call the API functions to interact with the EC.

**Additional Notes:**

* The `cros_ec_id` table defines the platform device IDs.
* The `__remove()` function is not defined in the provided code snippet.
* The `CROS_EC_DEV_NAME` constant should be defined elsewhere in the code.
