 This code is a function in C that writes an image to a blob (a region of memory) as PostScript. The function takes two arguments: `image_info` and `adjoin`. It starts by initializing variables for the boundaries of the image, the number of scenes, the bounding box, the page count, and a buffer to store formatted strings.

   The function then enters a loop that iterates over each image in the list of images to be written. Within this loop, the function writes the PostScript header for the image, including information about the pages, document title, creation date, and image bounds. The function also handles cases where the image should be cropped or tiled, as well as adjusting the page offset and scaling the image if necessary.

   After writing the header, the function enters a switch statement that writes the actual image data to the blob, depending on the compression type specified in the `image_info` structure. The available compression types are RLE (run-length encoding), LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch), and NoCompression. For each pixel in the image, the function writes its color index to the blob as a hexadecimal string, with appropriate line breaks inserted to keep the lines within 80 characters.

   After writing all of the images to the blob, the function writes the PostScript trailer, including the total number of pages and the bounding box for the document. Finally, the function closes the blob and returns `MagickTrue` to indicate that the operation was successful.
