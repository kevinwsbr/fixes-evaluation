**Purpose**

The provided code snippet defines a set of functions and data structures related to LoongArch CPUs in a software emulation environment.

**Key Features**

- **CPU Class:** Defines the base class for LoongArch CPUs, including common methods and properties.
- **CPU Types:** Defines specific LoongArch CPU types, such as `la464`.
- **State Management:** Includes a virtual machine state description for LoongArch CPUs.
- **TCG Operations:** Configures the TCG (Tiny Code Generator) operations for LoongArch CPUs.
- **QAPI Interface:** Provides a mechanism to query available CPU definitions.

**Components**

- **LoongArchCPUClass:** Class containing the common properties and methods for all LoongArch CPUs.
- **LoongArchCPU:** Instance of the LoongArchCPUClass.
- **loongarch_cpu_type_infos:** Array of TypeInfo structures defining the LoongArch CPU types.
- **qmp_query_cpu_definitions:** Function to retrieve a list of available CPU definitions.

**Usage**

The code snippet can be used to:

- Create instances of LoongArch CPUs.
- Query available CPU definitions.
- Perform CPU emulation and other operations within the software emulation environment.

**Additional Notes**

- The code is compiled with the `CONFIG_TCG` option, enabling TCG operations.
- The `CONFIG_USER_ONLY` option is not defined, indicating that the code is not restricted to user-mode applications.
- The code includes header files for CPU operations, virtual machine state, and TCG operations.
