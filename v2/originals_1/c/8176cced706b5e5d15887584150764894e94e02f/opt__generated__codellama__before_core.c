This is a part of the Linux kernel source code for the `perf` subsystem. It defines several functions related to managing performance events, such as allocating and freeing memory for event structures, handling event group membership changes, and enabling and disabling events.

The first function defined in this block of code is `perf_event_mmap`, which is called when a user process maps the `/dev/mem` file into its address space.

The eightieth function defined in this block of code is `perf_event_mmap_page_ctor`, which is called when a user process maps a `/dev/mem` file into its address space using the `mmap` system call.

The eightieth function defined in this block of code is `perf_event_sysfs_init`, which is called during system initialization to register the `perf` subsystem with the Linux kernel. It creates a new bus for the `perf` subsystem, allocates memory for each available performance event type, and sets up the necessary hooks to handle events as they are generated by the hardware.

The eightieth function defined in this block of code is `perf_event_open`, which is called when a user process opens a `/dev/perf_events` file descriptor.
