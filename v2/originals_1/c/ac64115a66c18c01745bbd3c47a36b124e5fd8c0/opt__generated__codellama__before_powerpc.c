 2. To find the corresponding function, we can use the following steps:

a. First, we need to identify the file that contains the ioctl. We can do this by searching for `KVMIO` in the code base and finding the `ioctl` line in the output. This is found in [INST:ppc_kvm_device.h] in the line `KVMIO`.
b. Next, we need to find the function that handles the ioctl. We can do this by searching for `case KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID` in the file found in step a. This is found in the function named `ioctl_kvm_ppc`.
c. Finally, we need to identify the structure that contains the information about the ioctl. We can do this by searching for `struct kvm_ppc_getcpuid`. This structure is found inside the `case` statement in step b.
d. With these steps completed, we have identified the file and function that contain the information about the ioctl, as well as the structure that contains the information about the ioctl.
