This is the function that cleans up all the resources used by airodump-ng. It first frees any memory allocated for the program's data structures, including the list of available cards and the list of detected access points. It then closes any open files and releases any resources associated with them. Finally, it resets the terminal to its original state using the `fprintf` function with `stderr`.

The function first checks if the program's data structures have been initialized, and if so, cleans up all the resources used by them. It then closes any open files and releases any resources associated with them, including the capture file, the output file, and the GPS file. If the `save_gps` option is set to false, it also deletes the temporary GPS file created for the current session.

The function then frees all memory allocated by the program, including the list of access points, the list of stations, and any other data structures used by the program. It then sets the `G.f_cap` field to NULL, which indicates that no capture file is open.

Finally, the function resets the terminal to its original state using the `fprintf` function with `stderr`. This ensures that the terminal is properly reset even if an error occurs during program execution.
