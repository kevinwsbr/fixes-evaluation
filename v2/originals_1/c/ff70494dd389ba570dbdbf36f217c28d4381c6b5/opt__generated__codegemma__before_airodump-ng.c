**Code Overview:**

The provided code snippet is a C function that is part of an application that scans for and analyzes wireless networks. It performs various tasks, including:

- Freeing allocated memory
- Closing network interfaces
- Dumping data to files in different formats
- Cleaning and freeing data structures associated with access points, stations, network adapters, and manufacturers

**Function Steps:**

1. **Start Timer:** Records the elapsed time at the start of the function.

2. **Free Memory:** Frees memory allocated for various data structures, including:
    - Own channels
    - ESSID
    - Prefix
    - Channel name
    - Keyout
    - Regular expression for ESSID

3. **Close Network Interfaces:** Closes all network interfaces used by the application.

4. **Write Data:** Writes captured data to files based on the specified output format.

5. **Remove GPS File:** If GPS data is not being saved, the GPS file is deleted.

6. **Clean AP List:** Cleans the data structures associated with each access point, including unique identifiers, packets, anomaly data, and manufacturer information.

7. **Free AP List:** Frees the memory allocated for each access point in the list.

8. **Free Station List:** Frees the memory allocated for each station in the list.

9. **Free Network Adapter List:** Frees the memory allocated for each network adapter in the list.

10. **Free Manufacturer List:** Frees the memory allocated for each manufacturer in the list.

11. **Restore Cursor Visibility:** Restores the cursor visibility to its original state.

**Conclusion:**

The code snippet performs a comprehensive cleanup of the application's resources and data structures. It ensures that all allocated memory is freed, network interfaces are closed, and data files are properly closed and written. This helps to prevent memory leaks and ensures a clean exit from the application.
