**sctp_assoc_set_id()**

- Sets an association ID for a given SCTP association.
- Returns 0 on success, or a negative error code on failure.

**sctp_assoc_free_asconf_queue()**

- Frees the ASCONF queue for a given SCTP association.

**sctp_assoc_free_asconf_acks()**

- Frees the ASCONF_ACK cache for a given SCTP association.

**sctp_assoc_clean_asconf_ack_cache()**

- Cleans up the ASCONF_ACK queue for a given SCTP association up to the "Peer-Sequence-Number".

**sctp_assoc_lookup_asconf_ack()**

- Finds the ASCONF_ACK chunk whose serial number matches the given serial number.

**sctp_asconf_queue_teardown()**

- Tears down the ASCONF queue and cache for a given SCTP association.

**Purpose:**

These functions are part of the SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) stack and are responsible for managing the ASCONF (Association Configuration) queue and cache. The ASCONF queue is used to store outgoing ASCONF (Association Configuration) messages, while the ASCONF_ACK cache stores incoming ASCONF_ACK (Association Configuration Acknowledgement) messages.

**Key Features:**

- **Association ID Assignment:** `sctp_assoc_set_id()` assigns an association ID to a new association.
- **ASCONF Queue Management:** `sctp_assoc_free_asconf_queue()` frees the ASCONF queue, while `sctp_asconf_queue_teardown()` tears it down completely.
- **ASCONF_ACK Cache Management:** `sctp_assoc_free_asconf_acks()` frees the ASCONF_ACK cache, and `sctp_assoc_clean_asconf_ack_cache()` cleans it up.
- **ASCONF_ACK Lookup:** `sctp_assoc_lookup_asconf_ack()` searches the cache for an ASCONF_ACK chunk with a matching serial number.

**Usage:**

These functions are typically used by the SCTP stack to manage the association configuration process. The `sctp_assoc_set_id()` function is called when a new association is created, while the other functions are used to handle ASCONF and ASCONF_ACK messages.
