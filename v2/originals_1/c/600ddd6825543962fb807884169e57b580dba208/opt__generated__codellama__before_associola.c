  This is a part of the SCTP protocol implementation in Linux kernel, and it contains some helper functions for handling the ASCONF chunk.

The function `sctp_assoc_new` is called when a new association is created, it allocates an ID for the association using the `idr_alloc_cyclic` function and initializes other fields of the association structure.

The function `sctp_assoc_free_asconf_queue` frees all ASCONF chunks in the association's queue.

The function `sctp_assoc_free_asconf_acks` frees all cached ASCONF ACK chunks in the association structure.

The function `sctp_assoc_clean_asconf_ack_cache` cleans up the ASCONF ACK cache by removing all entries that are not needed anymore, which means the entry with the same serial number as the peer's last received ASCONF sequence number.

The function `sctp_assoc_lookup_asconf_ack` looks up a cached ASCONF ACK chunk whose serial number matches the given serial number, and it returns the found chunk or NULL if there is no such chunk in the cache.
