  This code is setting up a bunch of variables and arrays for the kernel's TCP/IP stack. It's difficult to read because it's written in a way that makes it hard to follow the logic flow. However, it looks like it's initializing some TCP-related variables and calling some functions.

It's also using `EXPORT_SYMBOL` to make sure that the functions are exported for use by other parts of the kernel. This is a way of making functions available to other modules or drivers, which can be useful when you want to share functionality between different parts of your system.
