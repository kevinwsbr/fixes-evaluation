 This is a segment of the source code for the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel. Here's what each function does:

1. `tcp_close`: This function is used to close a TCP socket. It marks the socket as closed and notifies any pending operations, such as read or write requests, that are waiting on this socket. The actual cleanup and resource deallocation are performed when all references to the socket have been released.

2. `tcp_disconnect`: This function is used to disconnect a TCP connection, which means it gracefully shuts down the sending side of the connection and allows any remaining data to be drained out. It eventually releases resources associated with the connection when all references are gone.

3. `tcp_getsockopt`: This function retrieves socket options for the specified TCP socket. Socket options control various aspects of how a socket operates, such as whether it is blocking or non-blocking, its send and receive buffer sizes, etc.

4. `tcp_ioctl`: This function performs I/O control operations on a TCP socket. It supports several ioctl commands for getting and setting socket options, querying connection information, enabling or disabling certain features, etc.

5. `tcp_poll`: This function is used to check the readiness of a TCP socket for reading or writing data. It checks whether there's data available to be read from the socket (e.g., when it receives data from its peer) or if the socket is ready to accept outgoing data without blocking the caller.

6. `tcp_read_sock`: This function reads data from a TCP socket and copies it into a provided buffer, up to a specified length. It is responsible for handling any available data in the socket's receive buffer.

7. `tcp_recvmsg`: This function receives data on a connected TCP socket and stores it in the provided message buffer (or buffers). It also retrieves ancillary information about the received packet, such as its destination address or interface index.

8. `tcp_sendmsg`: This function sends data over a connected TCP socket using the provided message buffer (or buffers) containing the outgoing data and any relevant options or flags.

9. `tcp_splice_read`: This function is used to optimize data transfer by copying received TCP data directly into a pipe without going through user space, which can improve performance in certain scenarios.

10. `tcp_sendpage`: This function sends data from a page cache over a connected TCP socket, reducing the overhead of data copying between kernel and user spaces.

11. `tcp_setsockopt`: This function sets various socket options for a given TCP socket, similar to `tcp_getsockopt`.

12. `tcp_shutdown`: This function is used to shut down one or both halves of a full-duplex connection. Depending on the specified mode (read, write, or both), it will stop data flow in the corresponding direction and close the socket when appropriate.

   Overall, this segment provides essential functions for managing TCP connections, handling I/O operations, setting socket options, and performing control operations on TCP sockets within a Linux kernel environment.
