**Summary:**

The provided code snippet describes the initialization of the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) module. It includes the following key functions and configurations:

**Functions:**

- `tcp_close`: Closes a TCP connection.
- `tcp_disconnect`: Disconnects a TCP connection.
- `tcp_getsockopt`: Retrieves socket options for a TCP connection.
- `tcp_ioctl`: Processes TCP-specific ioctl commands.
- `tcp_poll`: Checks if there is data available to be read from a TCP socket.
- `tcp_read_sock`: Reads data from a TCP socket.
- `tcp_recvmsg`: Receives messages from a TCP socket.
- `tcp_sendmsg`: Sends messages through a TCP socket.
- `tcp_splice_read`: Splices data from a TCP socket to another file descriptor.
- `tcp_sendpage`: Sends data pages through a TCP socket.
- `tcp_setsockopt`: Sets socket options for a TCP connection.
- `tcp_shutdown`: Shuts down a TCP socket.

**Configurations:**

- **Hash tables:** The code configures two hash tables, `tcp_hashinfo.ehash` and `tcp_hashinfo.bhash`, for storing TCP connections and bind information.
- **Memory limits:** The code sets memory limits for TCP connections based on the available RAM, with a minimum of 128 pages.
- **Congestion control:** The code registers the TCP Reno congestion control algorithm.
- **Secret keys:** The code initializes two secret keys and sets the current secret key.

**Initialization Process:**

The code performs the following steps during initialization:

- Initializes the hash tables.
- Adjusts memory limits based on available RAM.
- Registers the TCP Reno congestion control algorithm.
- Initializes secret keys.

**Conclusion:**

The code snippet provides a comprehensive overview of the TCP module initialization process, including the configuration of hash tables, memory limits, congestion control, and secret keys.
