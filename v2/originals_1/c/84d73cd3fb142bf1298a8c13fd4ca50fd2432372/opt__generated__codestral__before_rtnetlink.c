 The provided code is a part of the Linux kernel's networking subsystem. It initializes and registers the rtnetlink protocol used for exchanging network configuration information between user space applications and the kernel.

Here's an overview of what each function does:

1. `rtnetlink_event(struct notifier_block *notifier, unsigned long event, void *ptr)` - This is a callback function that handles various networking events such as interface registration, unregistration, changes in state, etc. Depending on the type of event, it may call the `rtmsg_ifinfo()` function to send an RTM_NEWLINK message to user space applications.
2. `rtnetlink_rcv(struct sk_buff *skb)` - This is a callback function that handles incoming rtnetlink messages from user space applications. It parses the message, validates it, and then calls the appropriate rtnetlink handler function based on the message type (e.g., RTM_GETLINK, RTM_SETLINK, RTM_NEWLINK, etc.).
3. `rtnetlink_net_init(struct net *net)` - This function is called when a new network namespace is created. It creates a new rtnetlink socket and stores it in the network structure for later use.
4. `rtnetlink_net_exit(struct net *net)` - This function is called when a network namespace is destroyed. It releases the rtnetlink socket and removes it from the network structure.
5. `rtnetlink_init()` - This function is called during kernel initialization to perform global rtnetlink initialization tasks such as allocating memory for rtattr buffers, registering per-network operations, and registering event notifiers. It also registers various rtnetlink handlers for different message types (e.g., RTM_GETLINK, RTM_SETLINK, etc.).

Overall, the code sets up the infrastructure needed to support the rtnetlink protocol and handle network configuration requests from user space applications.
