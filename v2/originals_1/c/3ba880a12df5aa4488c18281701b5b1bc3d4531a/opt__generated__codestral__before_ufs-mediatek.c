 This is the driver code for a MediaTek UFS (Universal Flash Storage) host controller. It's written in C and uses the Linux kernel platform driver framework. Here are some key parts of this file explained:

1. **Headers and Macros**: The necessary headers are included at the top, including `ufshcd.h` for UFSHCD (Universal Flash Storage Host Controller Driver) functions and `reset-mtk.h` for a custom reset function used in MediaTek devices.

2. **Structures**: The `ufs_hba_mtk_vops` structure is defined, which holds pointers to various functions that implement the UFSHCD operations needed by this driver. Some of these functions are placeholders (such as `fmp_init`) and some are implemented in this file (like `suspend`, `resume`, and `dbg_register_dump`).

3. **Probe Function**: The `ufs_mtk_probe` function is the probe routine for the driver. It initializes the UFS host controller by calling `ufshcd_pltfrm_init` with the appropriate arguments. This function also handles the reset functionality specific to MediaTek devices.

4. **Remove Function**: The `ufs_mtk_remove` function is called when the driver is removed from the system. It gets the device data, disables runtime power management, and then calls `ufshcd_remove`.

5. **Power Management Operations**: The `ufs_mtk_pm_ops` structure defines the power management operations for this driver. These include suspend, resume, prepare, and complete functions.

6. **Platform Driver Structure**: Finally, the `ufs_mtk_pltform` structure is defined. This structure holds pointers to the probe, remove, shutdown, and driver fields necessary to register this platform driver with the Linux kernel. The driver field also includes a pointer to the power management operations structure.

The module is then registered at the end of the file using `module_platform_driver`.
