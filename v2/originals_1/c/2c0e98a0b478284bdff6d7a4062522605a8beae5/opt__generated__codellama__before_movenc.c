  These are the definitions for several formats that are supported by libavformat.

1. `ipod`: This is an MP4 format that is commonly used on iPods and other Apple devices. It supports audio and video tracks, as well as a metadata structure for storing information such as the track name and album art.
2. `ismv`: This is an ISMV (Smooth Streaming) format that is used for streaming video over the internet. It is based on the MP4 container, but with some additional features to support streaming.
3. `f4v`: This is an F4V format that is used by Adobe Flash to store video streams. It supports both audio and video tracks, as well as metadata such as track names and album art.

These formats are defined using the `MOV_CLASS` macro, which defines a structure for each format that contains information about the format's properties, such as its name, long name, mime type, extensions, codec tags, etc. The `init`, `write_header`, `write_packet`, and `write_trailer` functions are also defined for each format, which are used by libavformat to handle the different stages of writing data to a file in these formats.
