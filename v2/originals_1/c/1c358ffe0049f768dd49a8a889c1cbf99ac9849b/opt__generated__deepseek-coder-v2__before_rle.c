 These two functions, `RegisterRLEImage` and `UnregisterRLEImage`, are used to register and unregister the RLE image format with ImageMagick. Let's break down what each function does and how they contribute to the functionality of ImageMagick.

### RegisterRLEImage Function

The `RegisterRLEImage` function is responsible for registering the RLE (Run Length Encoded) image format with ImageMagick. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of its purpose and implementation:

1. **AcquireMagickInfo**: This function acquires an entry in the MagickInfo structure, which holds information about the image format. It is given the tag "RLE", the magic word "RLE" (which likely stands for Run Length Encoded), and a description "Utah Run length encoded image".

2. **Set Handlers**: 
   - `decoder`: This is set to `ReadRLEImage`, which is presumably a function that can decode RLE images.
   - `magick`: This is set to `IsRLE`, which likely checks if an image is in the RLE format.
   
3. **Flags**: The `flags` are adjusted by removing the `CoderAdjoinFlag`. This flag typically indicates whether the coder supports saving multiple frames, but since this might not be applicable to RLE images (it could support more than one frame, depending on how it's implemented), this step is important for ensuring compatibility with other parts of ImageMagick.

4. **RegisterMagickInfo**: Finally, this entry is registered with ImageMagick, allowing future operations to recognize and handle RLE files accordingly.

### UnregisterRLEImage Function

The `UnregisterRLEImage` function is used to remove the registration of the RLE image format from ImageMagick:

1. **UnregisterMagickInfo**: This function calls `UnregisterMagickInfo` with the tag "RLE", effectively removing all registered information about the RLE format, thus undoing what `RegisterRLEImage` did when it was called.

### Summary

- **RegisterRLEImage**: Registers the RLE image format with ImageMagick by setting up its handlers and providing necessary metadata. This makes ImageMagick aware of how to handle RLE images.
  
- **UnregisterRLEImage**: Reverts back to a state where ImageMagick does not recognize or know how to handle RLE images, effectively undoing the registration made by `RegisterRLEImage`.

These functions are crucial for maintaining and extending the support of various image formats in ImageMagick, allowing it to handle more than just standard file types.
