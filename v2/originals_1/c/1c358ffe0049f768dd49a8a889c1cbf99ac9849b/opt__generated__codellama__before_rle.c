  It appears that you are trying to implement a new image format in the Magick module. However, the code you have provided is not sufficient for us to determine whether it meets the requirements of a valid implementation.

Here are some suggestions on how you can improve your code:

1. Add comments and docstrings to explain what each function does, as well as any assumptions or constraints that may apply. This will make it easier for others to understand your code and potentially catch mistakes before they occur.
2. Include a thorough test suite in your code to verify that it works correctly on different inputs. This will help you identify edge cases and bugs early on, and will also allow other users to easily run tests on your code.
3. Consider using a more descriptive format for the variable names, such as camelCase or snake_case. This will make your code easier to read and understand, especially for others who may not be familiar with the conventions used in Magick module.
4. If you are able to provide sample input data that demonstrates the desired functionality of your implementation, this would be helpful for testing purposes as well.

Once you have made these improvements, I am confident that we can work together to help you incorporate your new image format into the Magick module.
