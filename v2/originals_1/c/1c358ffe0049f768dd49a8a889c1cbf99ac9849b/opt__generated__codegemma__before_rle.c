**Purpose**

The provided code snippet defines a series of functions for reading and registering the RLE (Run-Length Encoded) image format in the MagickImage library.

**Functions**

**1. ReadRLEImage()**

- Reads an RLE image from a binary stream.
- Checks for errors during image decoding.
- Returns the first image in the decoded image list.

**2. IsRLE()**

- Checks if a given image file is in RLE format.
- Uses the file signature "\122\314" to identify RLE files.

**3. RegisterRLEImage()**

- Registers the RLE image format with MagickImage.
- Provides attributes such as image format tag, decoding method, and description.

**4. UnregisterRLEImage()**

- Removes the RLE image format registration from MagickImage.

**Usage**

To use the RLE image format, you would first need to register it using the `RegisterRLEImage()` function. Then, you can use the `ReadRLEImage()` function to read RLE images.

**Code Breakdown**

The code snippet defines the following steps:

- Registering the RLE image format with MagickImage using `RegisterRLEImage()`.
- Creating a decoder handler for RLE images using `ReadRLEImage()`.
- Defining a method to check if a file is an RLE image using `IsRLE()`.
- Unregistering the RLE image format when done using `UnregisterRLEImage()`.

**Benefits**

- Enables the use of RLE images in MagickImage applications.
- Provides a convenient way to read and work with RLE image data.

**Additional Notes**

- The RLE image format is known for its efficient compression and speed.
- The `SyncAuthenticPixels()` function is used to ensure the integrity of decoded image data.
- The `EOFBlob()` function checks for unexpected end-of-file errors.
