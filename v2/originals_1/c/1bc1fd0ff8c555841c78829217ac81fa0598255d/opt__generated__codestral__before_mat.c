 This is a C function that saves an image or a sequence of images in MATLAB format. The function takes as input an Image object and writes the data to a file using the WriteBlob() functions. The function first checks if the image is grayscale, and then stores the appropriate header information for either grayscale or color images. It then loops over each row of pixels in the image, converts the pixel values to the appropriate format, and writes them to the file using WriteBlob(). If there are multiple images to be saved, the function loops over each image in the list and saves it in turn. The progress of saving is also updated using SetImageProgress() function. Finally, the function closes the blob (file) and returns MagickTrue if the operation was successful.
