This function takes an image and writes it to a file in the MAT format. The MAT format is a simple binary format that consists of a header followed by the pixel data. The header includes information such as the dimensions of the image, the number of channels, and the type of each channel (e.g., 8-bit unsigned integer).

The function starts by writing the header for the MAT file using WriteBlobLSBLong(). It then loops over each row of pixels in the image, exporting them to a buffer using ExportQuantumPixels() and writing the buffer to the output file using WriteBlob(). After writing each pixel row, the function writes any necessary padding bytes to ensure that the next pixel is aligned on an 8-byte boundary.

The function uses the QuantumInfo structure to manage the mapping between the image data and the MAT format. The quantum_info variable is initialized with AcquireQuantumInfo(), which allocates memory for the quantum pixels buffer, then destroyed with DestroyQuantumInfo().

The function also uses the WriteBlobLSB* functions to write the header in little-endian byte order (i.e., least significant byte first). These functions are used instead of WriteBlob() because the MAT header has a specific format that requires each value to be written in little-endian order, rather than the default big-endian order used by WriteBlob().

Overall, this function provides a simple way to write an image in the MAT format. It is useful for debugging purposes or as a starting point for more advanced MAT file manipulation functions.
