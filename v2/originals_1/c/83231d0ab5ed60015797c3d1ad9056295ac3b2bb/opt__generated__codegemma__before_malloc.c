**GC_free() Function**

The `GC_free()` function is responsible for deallocating an object in a garbage-collected (GC) system. It handles both small and large objects.

**Arguments:**

* `p`: Pointer to the object to be deallocated.

**Functionality:**

**1. Lock Acquisition:**

- The function acquires the GC lock to ensure thread safety.

**2. Object Type Check:**

- It determines the type of object by examining the `hb_obj_kind` field in the header.
- If the object is small (<= MAXOBJGRANULES), it is handled differently than large objects.

**3. Small Object Handling:**

- It calculates the number of granules required for the object.
- It decrements the `GC_bytes_freed` and `GC_non_gc_bytes` counters accordingly.
- It sets the mark bit in the header to 0.
- It links the object to the free list of the corresponding object kind.

**4. Large Object Handling:**

- It calculates the number of blocks required for the object.
- It decrements the `GC_bytes_freed`, `GC_non_gc_bytes`, and `GC_large_allocd_bytes` counters.
- It frees the header block using `GC_freehblk()`.

**5. Lock Release:**

- The function releases the GC lock.

**GC_free_inner() Function (Internal Function)**

- This function is similar to `GC_free()` but is used when we already hold the GC lock.
- It takes the same arguments as `GC_free()` but performs the deallocation operations without acquiring the lock.

**REDIRECT_FREE Macro**

- This macro redefines the `free()` function to call `GC_free()` instead of the original `free()` function.
- This ensures that all memory allocated using `malloc()` is properly deallocated using `GC_free()`.

**Usage:**

- Objects allocated using `malloc()` should be deallocated using `GC_free()` instead of `free()`.
- This ensures that the GC system can properly manage these objects and prevent memory leaks.

**Note:**

- The `IGNORE_FREE` macro can be defined to prevent `GC_free()` from being called in certain situations.
- The `GC_LINUX_THREADS` and `USE_PROC_FOR_LIBRARIES` macros are used to handle thread-specific initialization checks.
