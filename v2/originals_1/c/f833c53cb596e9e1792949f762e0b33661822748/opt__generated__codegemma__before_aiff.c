**aiff_read_basc_chunk() Function:**

- Reads the BASC chunk data from an AIFF file.
- Extracts the root note, start time, and loop information from the chunk.
- Reads the specified number of bytes from the file.
- Returns 0 on success, or an error code on failure.

**aiff_read_chanmap() Function:**

- Reads the channel map chunk data from an AIFF file.
- Determines the channel layout based on the layout tag.
- Allocates memory for the channel map.
- Reads the channel map data from the file.
- Returns 0 on success, or an error code on failure.

**aiff_set_chunk() Function:**

- Saves a chunk of data to the AIFF file.

**aiff_next_chunk_iterator() Function:**

- Returns an iterator for iterating over the chunks in the file.

**aiff_get_chunk_size() Function:**

- Gets the size of a chunk at the specified iterator position.

**aiff_get_chunk_data() Function:**

- Reads the data of a chunk at the specified iterator position.

**Purpose:**

These functions are part of a library for reading and writing AIFF files. They provide functionality for reading and accessing chunk data, including the BASC chunk and channel map.

**Usage:**

To use these functions, create an instance of the `SF_PRIVATE` struct and call the `aiff_read()` function to read an AIFF file. Then, use the `aiff_next_chunk_iterator()` and `aiff_get_chunk_size()` functions to iterate over the chunks in the file and retrieve their data.

**Notes:**

- The `aiff_read()` function must be called before using the other functions.
- The `aiff_set_chunk()` function should be called before closing the file.
- The `SF_CHUNK_INFO` struct is used to store information about a chunk.
