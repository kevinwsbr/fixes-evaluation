**Module Initialization**

* Registers the `sit_net_ops` structure as a pernet device, responsible for handling IPv6, IPv4, and MPLS over IPv4 tunnels.
* Registers the `sit_handler` for IPv6 tunnels and the `ipip_handler` for IPv4 tunnels.
* Registers the `sit_link_ops` for the "sit" RTNL link type.

**IPv6 Tunnel Initialization**

* Creates a new `sit_net` device structure for each network namespace.
* Initializes the tunnel device with necessary parameters, including the tunnel name and tunnel type.
* Clones the 6rd tunnel configuration.
* Initializes the IPIP6 tunnel for the IPv6 tunnel.

**IPv4 Tunnel Initialization**

* Creates a new `ipip_tunnel` device structure for each IPv4 tunnel.
* Initializes the tunnel device with necessary parameters, including the tunnel name and tunnel type.

**Module Cleanup**

* Unregisters the RTNL link type.
* Deregisters the IPIP and SIT tunnel handlers.
* Unregisters the pernet device.

**Key Features**

* Supports IPv6, IPv4, and MPLS over IPv4 tunnels.
* Provides a pernet device for managing tunnel devices.
* Uses the RTNL link layer for tunnel management.
* Offers a configuration API for setting up tunnels.

**Module Usage**

* The module is automatically loaded during kernel initialization.
* Tunnel devices can be created using the `ip tunnel add` command.
* The `sit_net` structure provides access to tunnel configuration and management functions.

**Additional Notes**

* The module supports MPLS over IPv4 tunnels if the `CONFIG_MPLS` option is enabled.
* The `sit_exit_batch_net()` function handles cleanup for tunnels in exiting network namespaces.
* The `sit_net_ops` structure defines the initialization and exit functions for pernet devices.
