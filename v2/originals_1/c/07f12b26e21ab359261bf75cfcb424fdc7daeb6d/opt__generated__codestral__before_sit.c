 This code is a Linux kernel module that implements the IPv6, IPv4 and MPLS over IPv4 tunneling driver. The main functionality of this module includes registering network devices, handling IPv6, IPv4 and MPLS tunnels, and managing tunnel interfaces.

   Here's a brief overview of the key functions in the code:

   1. `__init sit_init`: This function is called when the module is loaded into the kernel. It registers per-network device operations for SIT, which includes initialization and cleanup functions for each network namespace. Additionally, it registers the tunnel handlers for IPv6 (sit), IPv4 (ipip), and MPLS over IPv4 tunneling. Finally, it registers the link operations for the SIT interface.

   2. `__exit sit_cleanup`: This function is called when the module is unloaded from the kernel. It deregisters the link operations, tunnel handlers, and per-network device operations that were registered during initialization.

   3. `sit_init_net`: This function is called for each network namespace to initialize SIT-specific data structures. It allocates memory for the SIT net structure, initializes a list of tunnels, and registers the tunnel notifiers.

   4. `sit_exit_batch_net`: This function is called when a network namespace is being destroyed to clean up any remaining SIT resources. It iterates through the list of tunnels and destroys them one by one.

   5. `sit_dev_init`, `sit_tunnel_init`: These functions handle the creation and initialization of tunnel interfaces. `sit_dev_init` allocates a new network device, sets up its operations and callbacks, and registers it with the kernel. `sit_tunnel_init` creates a new SIT structure, initializes its parameters, and adds it to the list of tunnels for the current network namespace.

   6. `sit_dev_setup`, `sit_tunnel_setup`: These functions handle setting up the parameters of tunnel interfaces based on user input. They parse the tunnel attributes provided by userspace and store them in the SIT structure.

   7. `sit_dev_xmit`: This function is called when a packet is transmitted through a SIT tunnel interface. It handles encapsulating the packet with the appropriate IP header, adding MPLS labels if necessary, and sending it out through the underlying network device.

   Overall, this module provides the infrastructure for creating and managing tunnel interfaces that can be used to transport various types of traffic over an IPv4 network.
