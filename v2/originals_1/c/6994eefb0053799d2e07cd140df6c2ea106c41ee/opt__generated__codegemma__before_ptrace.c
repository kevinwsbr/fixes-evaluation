**ptrace() System Call in Linux**

The `ptrace()` system call in Linux allows a parent process to control and interact with a child process. It provides various operations such as reading and writing memory, sending signals, and getting/setting process information.

**Arguments:**

* `request`: Specifies the desired operation.
* `pid`: ID of the child process.
* `addr`: Memory address in the child process.
* `data`: Data to be written or read.

**Supported Requests:**

* `PTRACE_PEEKTEXT`: Read the word at the given address.
* `PTRACE_PEEKDATA`: Read the byte at the given address.
* `PTRACE_POKETEXT`: Write the word at the given address.
* `PTRACE_POKEDATA`: Write the byte at the given address.
* `PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG`: Get the event message from the child process.
* `PTRACE_GETSIGINFO`: Get the signal information.
* `PTRACE_SETSIGINFO`: Set the signal information.
* `PTRACE_GETREGSET`: Get the register set.
* `PTRACE_SETREGSET`: Set the register set.
* `PTRACE_TRACEME`: Attach the debugger to the process.
* `PTRACE_ATTACH`: Attach to the process with debugging capabilities.
* `PTRACE_KILL`: Send a SIGKILL signal to the process.
* `PTRACE_INTERRUPT`: Send an interrupt signal to the process.
* `PTRACE_DETACH`: Detach from the process.

**Implementation:**

The `compat_sys_ptrace()` function implements the `ptrace()` system call for compatibility with older Linux kernels. It handles different request types and interacts with the child process using the `ptrace()` system call.

**Key Points:**

* The `ptrace()` system call provides a mechanism for parent-child process interaction.
* It supports various operations for manipulating child process memory, signals, and registers.
* The `compat_sys_ptrace()` function provides backward compatibility for older kernels.
