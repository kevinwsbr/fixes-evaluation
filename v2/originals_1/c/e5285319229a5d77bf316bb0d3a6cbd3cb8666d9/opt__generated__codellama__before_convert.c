This is an implementation of the `imagetoraw` and `imagetorawl` functions in OpenJPEG. These functions are used to write a JPEG-2000 image to a raw file in memory-mapped mode or not, respectively. The `image` parameter is the input image data structure, which contains all the information about the image, and `outfile` is the name of the output file that will be written to.

The function first checks if the output file can be opened for writing, and if it cannot, returns with an error code. Then, it loops over each component of the input image and writes its data to the output file, according to the precision and sign of the component. The `imagetoraw` function is used for memory-mapped mode, while `imagetorawl` is used for not memory-mapped mode.

The `image->comps[compno].data` pointer points to the data of the current component being processed, and it is incremented after each pixel is written. The `image->comps[compno].prec` variable indicates the precision of the current component, which determines how many bits are used to represent its data. If the precision is greater than 8 or 16 bits, the function will print an error message and return with a non-zero exit code.

The `image->comps[compno].sgnd` variable indicates whether the current component has a signed or unsigned type. The `mask` variable is used to truncate the data of the current component to the correct number of bits, in order to prevent overflows when writing it to the output file.

The function returns with an error code if there was an issue during the writing process, and 0 otherwise.
