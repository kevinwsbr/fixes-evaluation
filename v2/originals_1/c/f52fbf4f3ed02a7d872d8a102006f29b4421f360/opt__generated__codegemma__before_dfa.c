**Decoder Capabilities**

The provided code defines a decoder for the Chronomaster DFA (Digital Film Archive) video codec. The decoder supports the following capabilities:

- **DR1:** Direct rendering to video memory, eliminating the need for intermediate buffer allocation.

**Decoder Initialization**

The `dfa_decode_init()` function initializes the decoder context by allocating memory for the following:

- `frame_buf`: A buffer to store decoded video frames.
- `pal`: A palette buffer to store color information.

**Frame Decoding**

The `dfa_decode_frame()` function performs the following steps:

1. Reads the packet header and extracts the chunk type and size.
2. Processes known chunk types (palette, video data) based on the specified decoder function.
3. Decodes video data into a buffer.
4. Maps the decoded buffer to the video frame.

**Frame Output**

The decoded video frame is stored in the `frame` variable, which is passed as an argument to the `dfa_decode_frame()` function.

**Decoder Termination**

The `dfa_decode_end()` function frees the allocated memory for the `frame_buf`.

**Code Structure**

The code is structured as follows:

- Header file containing the decoder definition.
- Source file containing the decoder implementation.

**Additional Notes**

- The decoder supports a maximum of 256 palette colors.
- The decoder handles video frames of a fixed size (480x720 pixels).
- The decoder does not support alpha channel.
