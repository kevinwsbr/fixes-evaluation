This function searches for a stream in an SDP message that matches the regular expression `re`, and deletes it if the `delete` parameter is set to 1. If no stream is found, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it returns 1.

The function first checks if the message has an SDP body, and then searches for a session in the SDP that contains at least one stream. For each stream in the session, it checks whether the media type matches the regular expression `re`. If `re2` is not NULL, it also checks whether the transport protocol matches the regular expression `re2`.

Once a match is found, the function looks for the beginning and end of the "m" line that represents the stream. It then creates a new lump by deleting the part of the message that represents the stream, and marks the stream as deleted by setting its length to 0.

The function uses the `handle_streams` function to perform the actual search and deletion of streams. The `re`, `re2`, and `delete` parameters are passed to this function. If `delete` is set to 1, the function will delete the matched stream; otherwise, it will simply return 1 if a match is found.

This function is useful for filtering out specific streams from an SDP message based on their media type or transport protocol. It can be used in various applications such as creating call hold/resume functionality, or filtering out unsupported codecs in a call.
