 These two functions, `RegisterCUTImage` and `UnregisterCUTImage`, are part of a module that likely deals with handling an image format called "CUT". The purpose of these functions is to register and unregister the CUT image format so that it can be recognized by image processing libraries or applications.

### RegisterCUTImage Function
The `RegisterCUTImage` function does the following:
1. **Creates a new entry in the MagickInfo structure** for the CUT image format, specifying its tag as "CUT" and providing a brief description ("DR Halo").
2. **Sets up a decoder function** to handle reading of CUT images by assigning `ReadCUTImage` to this entry's decoder field.
3. **Marks the format as seekable stream**, which means it can handle files where you can jump around, not just read sequentially from start to finish.
4. **Registers the new MagickInfo structure** with the image processing library by calling `RegisterMagickInfo`.
5. Returns a unique signature for CUT images (`MagickImageCoderSignature`), indicating that registration was successful.

### UnregisterCUTImage Function
The `UnregisterCUTImage` function:
1. **Removes the entry from the list of supported formats** by calling `UnregisterMagickInfo` with the tag "CUT". This effectively unregisters and de-registers the CUT image format, making it no longer recognized or handled by the library for this particular module.
2. Does so without returning any value (`void`), but since its purpose is to clean up registrations made during runtime, ensuring that resources are properly released or reset when the module is unloaded or a different format needs to be used.

These functions together manage how and when the CUT image format is available for use in an application or library, allowing it to be recognized and handled as specified by its registration details.
