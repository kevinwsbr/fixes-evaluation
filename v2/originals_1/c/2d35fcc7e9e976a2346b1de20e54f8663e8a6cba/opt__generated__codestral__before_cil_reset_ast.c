 This C code implements a function named `cil_reset_ast` which traverses an abstract syntax tree (AST) represented by a `cil_tree_node` structure. The purpose of this function is to reset various elements within the AST based on their node type, such as categories, levels, contexts, and constraints. This is likely used in a larger system that parses and manipulates security policies for a particular operating system.

   The `cil_reset_ast` function takes a pointer to the current tree node as an argument and returns an integer value indicating whether the reset operation was successful or not (using SEPOL_OK for success and SEPOL_ERR for failure). It uses the `cil_tree_walk` function to traverse the AST, calling the `__cil_reset_node` function on each node.

   The `__cil_reset_node` function is a private helper function that checks the type of the current node and performs the appropriate reset operation based on that type. For example, if the node type is CIL_SENSITIVITYCAT, it calls the `cil_reset_senscat` function to reset the sensitivity category associated with the node.

   The list of node types that are handled by this code includes:

* CIL_SENSITIVITYCAT
* CIL_CATSET
* CIL_LEVEL
* CIL_LEVELRANGE
* CIL_CONTEXT
* CIL_SIDCONTEXT
* CIL_FILECON
* CIL_IBPKEYCON
* CIL_IBENDPORTCON
* CIL_PORTCON
* CIL_NODECON
* CIL_GENFSCON
* CIL_NETIFCON
* CIL_PIRQCON
* CIL_IOMEMCON
* CIL_IOPORTCON
* CIL_PCIDEVICECON
* CIL_DEVICETREECON
* CIL_FSUSE
* CIL_SID
* CIL_CONSTRAIN and CIL_MLSCONSTRAIN
* CIL_VALIDATETRANS and CIL_MLSVALIDATETRANS
* CIL_DEFAULTUSER, CIL_DEFAULTROLE, and CIL_DEFAULTTYPE
* CIL_DEFAULTRANGE
* CIL_BOOLEANIF

   The code also includes a default case for any node types that are not explicitly handled. If the `cil_tree_walk` function fails to traverse the AST, an error message is logged and SEPOL_ERR is returned.
