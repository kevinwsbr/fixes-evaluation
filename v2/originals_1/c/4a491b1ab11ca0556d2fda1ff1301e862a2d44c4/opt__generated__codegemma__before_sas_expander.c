**Purpose:**

The code snippets provide functions for revalidating a SAS domain, discovering new devices on a SAS network, and handling SMP (Simple Message Protocol) requests.

**SAS Revalidation:**

- `sas_revalidate_domain()` function iterates through SAS devices and revalidates their connections.
- It uses `sas_rediscover()` function to revalidate each SAS device.
- The `sas_rediscover()` function checks if the attached SAS device is part of a wide port and sends broadcast messages to the other PHYs in the wide port.

**SAS Device Discovery:**

- `sas_discover_new()` function discovers new SAS devices connected to a SAS port.
- It sends discovery requests to the SAS devices and waits for responses.

**SMP Handling:**

- `sas_smp_handler()` function handles SMP requests received by a SAS device.
- It identifies the SAS device type and performs the necessary SMP task.
- The function uses the `smp_execute_task_sg()` function to execute the SMP task.

**Key Functions:**

- `sas_revalidate_domain()`
- `sas_rediscover()`
- `sas_discover_new()`
- `sas_smp_handler()`

**Usage:**

- `sas_revalidate_domain()` can be used to revalidate the SAS domain when connections are lost or when new devices are added.
- `sas_discover_new()` can be used to discover new SAS devices when a SAS port is connected.
- `sas_smp_handler()` can be used to handle SMP requests from SAS devices.

**Notes:**

- The code assumes that the SAS devices are configured with valid SAS addresses and that the network is connected.
- The SMP handling code only supports SMP tasks that can be executed using the Simple Data Transfer (SDT) protocol.
- The code may need to be modified depending on the specific SAS environment and SMP requirements.
