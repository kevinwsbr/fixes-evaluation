 The provided code is a collection of functions related to the SMB2 protocol. Here's a brief explanation of each function:

1. `smb2_lockv`: This function sends an SMB2 lock request for multiple locks (num_lock) in buf. It initializes the SMB2 lock request header with the given parameters and then sends it to the server using SendReceive2 function. If there's any error during sending, it will be returned.

2. `SMB2_lock`: This function is a wrapper around smb2_lockv that simplifies sending an SMB2 lock request for only one lock. It initializes the lock element with the given parameters and calls smb2_lockv with num_lock set to 1.

3. `SMB2_lease_break`: This function sends an SMB2 lease break request to the server. It initializes the SMB2 lease break request header with the given parameters and then sends it to the server using SendReceiveNoRsp function. If there's any error during sending, it will be returned.

   These functions are all part of an implementation for a client that communicates with a server using the SMB2 protocol. The code assumes that the necessary structures and types are defined elsewhere in the project.
