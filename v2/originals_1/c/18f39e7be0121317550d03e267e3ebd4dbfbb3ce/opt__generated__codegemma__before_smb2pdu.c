**smb2_lockv Function:**

- The `smb2_lockv` function is responsible for issuing a SMB2 Lock command to the server.
- It takes several parameters, including the transaction context (tcon), persistent file ID, volatile file ID, process ID, number of locks, and an array of `smb2_lock_element` structures.
- The function initializes an `smb2_lock_req` structure and populates it with the required parameters.
- It then sends the command using the `SendReceive2` function and handles the response.
- If the response indicates an error, the function returns an error code.

**SMB2_lock Function:**

- The `SMB2_lock` function is a convenience function that simplifies the use of `smb2_lockv`.
- It takes additional parameters such as the offset, length, lock flags, and wait flag.
- It creates an `smb2_lock_element` structure with the provided parameters and calls `smb2_lockv` with it.

**SMB2_lease_break Function:**

- The `SMB2_lease_break` function is responsible for issuing an SMB2 Oplock Break command to the server.
- It takes the lease key and lease state as parameters.
- It initializes an `smb2_lease_ack` structure and populates it with the required parameters.
- It then sends the command using the `SendReceiveNoRsp` function.

**Usage:**

- The `SMB2_lock` function can be used to acquire locks on files.
- The `SMB2_lease_break` function can be used to break oplocks on files.

**Notes:**

- The `smb2_lockv` function requires the `smb2_lock_req` structure to be defined in the `smb2.h` header file.
- The `SendReceive2` and `SendReceiveNoRsp` functions are assumed to be available from a CIFS library.
- The `cifs_stats_fail_inc` function can be used to increment statistics for errors encountered during the SMB2 operations.
