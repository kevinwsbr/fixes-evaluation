**Arguments:**

- `polygon_primitive`: A pointer to a `PrimitiveInfo` structure representing the polygon.
- `mid`: The midpoint of the polygon.
- `threshold`: The threshold for determining the number of segments in the stroked polygon.
- `closed_path`: A boolean value indicating whether the polygon should be closed.

**Return Value:**

A pointer to a `PrimitiveInfo` structure representing the stroked polygon.

**Algorithm:**

The function works as follows:

1. Calculates the angle of each edge of the polygon.
2. Determines the number of segments needed to stroke the polygon based on the threshold.
3. Creates an array of points to represent the stroked polygon.
4. Traces the polygon by connecting the points in the array.

**Key Points:**

- The function handles closed polygons by connecting the first and last points.
- The `PerceptibleReciprocal()` function is used to calculate the threshold for segmenting the polygon.
- The `CheckPathExtent()` function is called to ensure the stroked polygon does not exceed the maximum stroke padding.

**Usage:**
