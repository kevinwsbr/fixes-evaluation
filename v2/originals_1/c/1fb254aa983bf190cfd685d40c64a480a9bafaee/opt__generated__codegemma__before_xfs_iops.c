**start_inode() Function:**

- Takes a pointer to an `xfs_inode` as input.
- Initializes the corresponding `inode` struct with the inode data from the `xfs_inode`.
- Sets the inode state to `I_NEW`.
- Adds the inode to the inode list.
- Makes the inode look hashed for writeback code.
- Sets the inode's user and group IDs.
- Sets the inode's size and file flags.
- Configures the inode's lock class and initializes the lock.
- Sets the page cache GFP mask to prevent reclaim recursion.
- Checks if there is an attribute fork and sets the ACL and file capabilities accordingly.

**xfs_setup_iops() Function:**

- Determines the inode type based on the `i_mode` field.
- Sets the inode and file operations for the corresponding type.
- Initializes the address space operations based on the presence of a DAX or regular file.

**Usage:**

The `start_inode()` function is typically called when a new inode is created. It initializes the inode's data and prepares it for use. The `xfs_setup_iops()` function is called after the inode is initialized to set up the appropriate I/O operations based on the inode type.

**Key Points:**

- Inode initialization includes setting various fields such as user and group IDs, size, and file flags.
- Locking and ACL/file capability configuration are also performed.
- The `xfs_setup_iops()` function configures the inode's I/O operations based on its type.
