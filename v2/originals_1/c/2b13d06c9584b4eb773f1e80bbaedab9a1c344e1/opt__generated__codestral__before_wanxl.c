 This is a Linux kernel module source code for the SBE Inc. wanXL series of serial port devices. The module handles PCI initialization, memory allocation, and device registration for HDLC (High-Level Data Link Control) communication. Here's a breakdown of some key functionalities in the code:

1. `wanxl_pci_init_one` function: This function is called when a matching PCI device is found during the probe phase. It performs various initialization tasks such as requesting and enabling memory regions, setting DMA mask, allocating IRQ, and creating network devices for each port on the card.

2. `wanxl_pci_remove_one` function: This function is called when a PCI device is removed from the system. It frees any allocated resources, disables IRQ, and releases memory regions.

3. The PCI driver structure (`wanxl_pci_driver`) defines the probe and remove functions for the driver.

4. `wanxl_init_module` function: This is the module initialization function that registers the PCI driver with the kernel.

5. `wanxl_cleanup_module` function: This is the module cleanup function that unregisters the PCI driver from the kernel when the module is removed or the system shuts down.

The code also includes functions for handling HDLC device attachment, transmission, and cable intrusion detection. The driver supports multiple ports on a single card, with each port having its own network device.
