 This code is a kernel module for the Marvell NFC (Near Field Communication) driver. It provides functions to register and unregister an NCI (Near-field communication Interface) device, receive frames from the device, reset or halt the chip, and parse device tree data.

The `nfcmrvl_nci_register_dev` function initializes the NFCMRVL private structure and registers it with the NCI subsystem using the specified device name and configuration. It also performs firmware download if required. If registration fails or firmware download fails, it cleans up any allocated resources and returns an error code.

The `nfcmrvl_nci_unregister_dev` function unregisters the NCI device from the subsystem and frees all allocated resources. It also aborts any ongoing firmware download if necessary.

The `nfcmrvl_nci_recv_frame` function receives a frame from the NFCMRVL device and processes it based on the HCI (Host Controller Interface) muxing configuration. If HCI is muxed, it extracts the NCI payload from the received frame. If firmware download is in progress, it calls the firmware download receiver function to handle the frame. Otherwise, if the NCI subsystem is running, it forwards the frame to the `nci_recv_frame` function for further processing.

The `nfcmrvl_chip_reset` and `nfcmrvl_chip_halt` functions reset or halt the NFCMRVL chip by setting the value of the reset GPIO pin based on the configuration.

The `nfcmrvl_parse_dt` function parses device tree data for the specified node to extract configuration information such as the reset GPIO pin and HCI muxing status. It returns 0 if successful, or an error code if any required configurations are missing or invalid.
