 The provided code snippet is from a Linux kernel module for an NFC (Near Field Communication) driver, specifically designed for Marvell chips. This module likely interfaces with hardware to facilitate communication between devices in close proximity, typically through contactless interaction. Here's an overview of the functions and their purposes within this module:

1. **nfcmrvl_nci_unregister_dev**: This function is responsible for unregistering a NCI (NFC Controller Interface) device from the system. It performs several steps including aborting any firmware download in progress, deinitializing the firmware download process, freeing GPIOs used for reset if applicable, and finally unregistering and freeing the NCI device itself before freeing the private data structure memory.

2. **nfcmrvl_nci_recv_frame**: This function handles incoming NFC frames. It checks whether HCI (Host Controller Interface) muxing is enabled; if so, it processes specific event codes from the frame. If firmware download is in progress, it passes the frame to a subroutine for handling within that context. Otherwise, it either forwards the frame to the NCI stack or drops it based on its status and whether someone is listening (indicated by the bit set in `priv->flags`).

3. **nfcmrvl_chip_reset**: This function initiates a software reset of the NFC chip by asserting and deasserting the reset line through GPIO, if such control is available (`gpio_is_valid(priv->config.reset_n_io)`). It uses `gpio_set_value` to set the GPIO state and `usleep_range` for the duration required for a reset operation.

4. **nfcmrvl_chip_halt**: Similar to `nfcmrvl_chip_reset`, this function asserts the reset line to halt the NFC chip, again using GPIO control if available.

5. **nfcmrvl_parse_dt**: This function parses device tree (DT) properties specific to the platform data for the Marvell NFC driver. It retrieves the GPIO pin number for the reset line and checks whether HCI muxing is enabled based on DT properties.

6. **Module Metadata**: The module metadata includes author information, a description of its purpose, and licensing details as per Linux kernel module standards.

These functions collectively manage the lifecycle and interactions of an NFC device managed by this driver, handling both hardware control and higher-level protocol interactions.
