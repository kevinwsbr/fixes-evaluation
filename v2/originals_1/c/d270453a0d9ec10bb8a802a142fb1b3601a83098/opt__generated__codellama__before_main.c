  This is the kernel module for the NFC chip. It exports several functions that are used by other modules to communicate with the NFC chip. These functions include `nfcmrvl_nci_register_dev`, which is called when a device driver registers itself with the NFC driver, `nfcmrvl_nci_unregister_dev`, which is called when a device driver unregisters itself from the NFC driver, and `nfcmrvl_nci_recv_frame`, which is called whenever an NCI packet is received by the driver. The module also exports the `nfcmrvl_chip_reset` function, which resets the chip, and the `nfcmrvl_chip_halt` function, which halts the chip. Finally, the module exports the `nfcmrvl_parse_dt` function, which parses the device tree to get configuration parameters for the NFC chip.
  
  The module also exports several variables and data structures that are used by other modules to communicate with the NFC chip. These include `ndev`, which is a pointer to the `nfc_dev` structure representing the NFC device, and `priv`, which is a pointer to the private data structure for the NFC driver.
  
  The module also includes several macros and functions that are used to define and implement the public interface of the NFC driver. These include `EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL`, which marks a function as exported, and `nfcmrvl_nci_register_dev`, which is called when a device driver registers itself with the NFC driver.
