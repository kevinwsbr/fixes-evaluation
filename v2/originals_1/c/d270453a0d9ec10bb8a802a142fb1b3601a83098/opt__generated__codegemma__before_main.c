**nfcmrvl_nci_register_dev()**

- Registers the NFC microcontroller (MC) with the NFC controller interface (NCI).
- Initializes the firmware download and NFC event handling.
- Allocates memory for the `nfcmrvl_private` structure.

**nfcmrvl_nci_unregister_dev()**

- Aborts the firmware download if in progress.
- Deinitializes the firmware download.
- Releases the reset GPIO pin if used.
- Unregisters the NCI device and frees the device structure.
- Frees the memory allocated for the `nfcmrvl_private` structure.

**nfcmrvl_nci_recv_frame()**

- Checks if the NFC controller is running.
- If running, it passes the received frame to the NCI device.
- If not running, it drops the packet.

**nfcmrvl_chip_reset()**

- Resets the NFC chip by toggling the reset GPIO pin.

**nfcmrvl_chip_halt()**

- Sets the reset GPIO pin to low to halt the NFC chip.

**nfcmrvl_parse_dt()**

- Parses the device tree node to extract configuration parameters, including the reset GPIO pin and HCI muxing setting.

**Usage:**

The `nfcmrvl_nci_register_dev()` function should be called to initialize the NFC driver. The `nfcmrvl_nci_unregister_dev()` function should be called to cleanup and release resources when the NFC driver is no longer needed.

**Key Features:**

- Supports NFC communication via NCI.
- Implements firmware download functionality.
- Provides a mechanism for resetting the NFC chip.

**Limitations:**

- Requires a valid NCI device.
- May require additional hardware configuration, such as a reset GPIO pin.
