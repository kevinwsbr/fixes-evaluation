This is a kernel module that provides functions for registering and deregistering symmetric key ciphers (SKCs) with the Linux kernel's Cryptographic API. It also provides functions for allocating and freeing instances of SKCs.

The `crypto_grab_skcipher` function is used to grab an instance of an SKC from a template. The `crypto_alloc_skcipher` function is used to allocate an instance of an SKC with a given name and type. The `crypto_has_skcipher2` function is used to check if an SKC with a given name, type, and mask exists in the kernel.

The `skcipher_prepare_alg` function is used to prepare an instance of an SKC for registration by setting its flags, cra_blocksize, and cra_alignmask. The `crypto_register_skcipher` function is used to register an instance of an SKC with the kernel. The `crypto_unregister_skcipher` function is used to unregister an instance of an SKC from the kernel.

The `crypto_register_skciphers` function is used to register multiple instances of SKCs with the kernel in a batch. The `crypto_unregister_skciphers` function is used to unregister multiple instances of SKCs from the kernel in a batch.

The `skcipher_register_instance` function is used to register an instance of an SKC with a template.
