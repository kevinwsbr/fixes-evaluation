 The provided code is a module for the Linux kernel that implements the symmetric key cipher type. It defines various functions and structures related to symmetric key cryptography, including encryption and decryption algorithms.

Here are some of the key components:

1. `crypto_grab_skcipher` function: This function is used to grab a symmetric key cipher algorithm based on the given name, type, and mask. It returns a pointer to the requested algorithm if available.
2. `crypto_alloc_skcipher` function: This function allocates a symmetric key cipher instance based on the provided algorithm name, type, and mask. If successful, it returns a pointer to the allocated instance.
3. `crypto_has_skcipher2` function: This function checks if a specific symmetric key cryptography algorithm is available based on the given name, type, and mask. It returns 1 if the algorithm is present; otherwise, it returns 0.
4. `crypto_register_skcipher` function: This function registers a new symmetric key cipher algorithm with the Linux kernel. The algorithm is defined by the `skcipher_alg` structure passed as an argument to the function. If successful, the function returns 0; otherwise, it returns an error code.
5. `crypto_unregister_skcipher` function: This function unregisters a previously registered symmetric key cipher algorithm from the Linux kernel. The algorithm is defined by the `skcipher_alg` structure passed as an argument to the function.
6. `crypto_register_skciphers` and `crypto_unregister_skciphers` functions: These functions are used to register or unregister multiple symmetric key cipher algorithms at once. They take a pointer to an array of `skcipher_alg` structures and the number of elements in the array as arguments.
7. `skcipher_register_instance` function: This function registers a new instance of a symmetric key cipher algorithm with the Linux kernel. The instance is defined by the `skcipher_instance` structure passed as an argument to the function. If successful, the function returns 0; otherwise, it returns an error code.
8. Module description and license: The module is licensed under the GPL (GNU General Public License) and provides a description of its functionality as a "Symmetric key cipher type" implementation for the Linux kernel.
