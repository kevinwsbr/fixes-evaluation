 The provided code snippet is part of a Linux kernel module for handling symmetric key ciphers in the crypto API. This module provides several functions to register, allocate, and manipulate skciphers (symmetric key ciphers). Below is an explanation of each function and its role within the module:

1. **`crypto_skcipher_show`**: This function is not defined in the snippet but is mentioned as a possible implementation for showing crypto information. It might be part of another function or method that handles cryptographic operations.

2. **`crypto_skcipher_report`**: Another placeholder function, this one likely deals with reporting on cryptographic functionalities.

3. **`maskclear` and `maskset`**: These functions manipulate the type and mask fields within a crypto structure to set or clear specific bits according to their definitions (`CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_MASK` and `CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_SKCIPHER_MASK`).

4. **`crypto_grab_skcipher`**: This function attempts to grab a skcipher instance based on the provided name, type, and mask. It uses `crypto_grab_spawn` to achieve this by setting the frontend type to `&crypto_skcipher_type2`.

5. **`crypto_alloc_skcipher`**: Allocates a new skcipher using the crypto API's `crypto_alloc_tfm` function, initializing it with the specified algorithm name and type.

6. **`crypto_has_skcipher2`**: Checks if a specific cryptographic algorithm is available by its name and type according to the provided mask. It uses `crypto_type_has_alg` to perform this check.

7. **`skcipher_prepare_alg`**: Prepares an skcipher algorithm structure for registration. This function sets up the algorithm's base type, clears certain flags related to types, and ensures that default values are set for optional fields (`chunksize` and `walksize`). It returns 0 on success or a negative error code otherwise.

8. **`crypto_register_skcipher`**: Registers an skcipher algorithm with the crypto API using `crypto_register_alg`. It first prepares the algorithm structure, then registers it.

9. **`crypto_unregister_skcipher`**: Unregisters an already registered skcipher algorithm by calling `crypto_unregister_alg`.

10. **`crypto_register_skciphers`** and **`crypto_unregister_skciphers`**: These functions are used to register or unregister multiple skcipher algorithms in bulk, respectively. They iterate over a list of algorithms and call the appropriate registration or unregistration function for each one.

11. **`skcipher_register_instance`**: Registers an instance of an skcipher algorithm template using `crypto_register_instance`. This is typically used to create instances from templates dynamically during runtime.

The module also includes several module metadata entries, such as the license type and a description of its purpose.

This set of functions forms part of the Linux kernel's crypto API infrastructure for managing cryptographic modules, allowing for flexible addition, allocation, and manipulation of symmetric key ciphers within the system.
