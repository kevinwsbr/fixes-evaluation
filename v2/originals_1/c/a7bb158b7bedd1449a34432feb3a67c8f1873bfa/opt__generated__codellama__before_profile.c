 The function `Sync8BimProfile` is a custom implementation that modifies an image's ICC profile in-place. It does this by reading the input image's ICC profile, and then modifying it according to some logic defined within the function. This logic appears to be specific to Adobe Photoshop's handling of color profiles, and it is not clear what the function is actually doing or why it is necessary for the intended use case (which is not specified in the code).

The function `SyncExifProfile` is also a custom implementation that modifies an image's EXIF profile in-place. It does this by reading the input image's EXIF profile, and then modifying it according to some logic defined within the function. This logic appears to be specific to Adobe Photoshop's handling of color profiles, and it is not clear what the function is actually doing or why it is necessary for the intended use case (which is not specified in the code).

The function `SyncImageProfiles` is a wrapper function that calls `Sync8BimProfile` and `SyncExifProfile`. It does this by reading each image's ICC profile and EXIF profile, and then passing them to the respective custom implementation functions. It does not appear to do anything with the output of these functions, and it simply returns a boolean value indicating whether any modifications were made to the input images.

It is not clear what the intended use case for this code is, or why it is necessary to modify an image's ICC profile in-place. The function `Sync8BimProfile` appears to be modifying some sort of internal data structure within the ICC profile itself, but it is not clear what that data structure is or what it represents. Similarly, the function `SyncExifProfile` also appears to be modifying some sort of internal data structure within the EXIF profile itself, but it is not clear what that data structure is or what it represents.

It is possible that this code is intended to be used as part of a larger application or framework, in which case the meaning and purpose of the functions may become clear in the context of that larger system. However, without more information about the intended use case, it is not possible to say for certain what this code is doing or why it is necessary.
