 This is a section of code written in C and it's used for encoding an image file using the OpenJPEG library. The function `WriteJP2Image` takes an ImageInfo structure and an Image structure as arguments, and it encodes the input image into JPEG 2000 format according to the specified parameters.

Here are some key points about this code:

* The code first checks if the OpenJPEG library is available at runtime. If not, it throws a writer exception indicating that the delegate library is missing.
* It then initializes various structures and settings required for encoding, such as creating an `opj_codec` structure, setting up the encoder parameters, and creating an `opj_stream` structure to handle input/output operations.
* The image data is converted into the desired format (such as grayscale or RGB) and stored in a buffer. This involves iterating over each pixel in the image, scaling the color values according to the specified parameters, and storing them in the appropriate location in the buffer.
* Once the image data has been prepared, the code calls various OpenJPEG functions to encode it into JPEG 2000 format. These functions include `opj_start_compress`, `opj_encode`, and `opj_end_compress`.
* If an error occurs during encoding, the function throws a writer exception with an appropriate error message. Otherwise, it closes any open resources and returns `MagickTrue` to indicate success.
