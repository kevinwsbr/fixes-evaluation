**Module Initialization and Cleanup:**

The provided code snippet defines a PCI driver for a FarSync WAN device (FST) using the Linux kernel module framework. The driver initializes and unloads the module during module loading and unloading.

**Driver Initialization:**

- Registers the FST driver with the PCI subsystem.
- Initializes an array of FST card information structures to keep track of initialized cards.
- Sets up a spin lock for synchronization.

**Driver Probe (Device Initialization):**

- Responds to PCI device discovery requests.
- Allocates a new FST card structure.
- Resets the processor and initializes DMA if required.
- Sets up driver data for the card.
- Initializes the card and allocates DMA buffers for TX and RX operations if applicable.
- Returns 0 on success, -ENOMEM on memory allocation failure.

**Driver Remove (Device Cleanup):**

- Unregisters the HDLC devices associated with the card's ports.
- Disables interrupts and unmaps memory regions.
- Frees DMA buffers if allocated.
- Sets the corresponding entry in the card array to NULL.

**Driver Structure:**

- The `fst_driver` structure contains information about the driver, including its name, PCI device IDs, probe and remove functions, and other attributes.

**Module Functions:**

- `fst_init`: Initializes the module and registers the FST driver.
- `fst_cleanup_module`: Unloads the module and cleans up resources.

**Key Points:**

- The driver supports up to `FST_MAX_CARDS` devices.
- DMA buffers are allocated for TX and RX operations only for TXU family cards.
- The driver uses a spin lock to synchronize access to shared resources.
- The `fst_card_array` stores pointers to initialized FST card structures.

**Conclusion:**

The provided code snippet provides a comprehensive example of a PCI driver for a FarSync WAN device in the Linux kernel. It demonstrates the process of driver initialization, device probe and removal, and resource management.
