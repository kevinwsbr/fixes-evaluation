 The provided code is a collection of functions related to asynchronous page fault (APF) handling, non-coherent DMA management, and tracepoint symbols in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) framework for x86 architecture.

Here's a brief explanation of each function:

1. `kvm_arch_async_page_fault`: This function is called when an APF occurs on a virtual CPU (vcpu). It checks if the APF MSR (Model Specific Register) is enabled and injects a page fault to the vCPU using the `kvm_inject_page_fault` function.

2. `kvm_arch_async_page_present`: This function is called when a previously faulted page becomes present again in memory. It checks if the APF MSR is enabled and injects a page fault to the vCPU using the `kvm_inject_page_fault` function, notifying that the page is ready now.

3. `kvm_arch_can_inject_async_page_present`: This function checks if it's safe to inject an APF page present event into a vCPU. It returns true if the APF MSR is disabled or if there are no events that need reinjection and interrupts are allowed.

4. `kvm_arch_register_noncoherent_dma`: This function increments the non-coherent DMA count for a KVM instance, indicating that there's an ongoing non-coherent DMA operation.

5. `kvm_arch_unregister_noncoherent_dma`: This function decrements the non-coherent DMA count for a KVM instance, indicating that a non-coherent DMA operation has completed or been cancelled.

6. `kvm_arch_has_noncoherent_dma`: This function checks if there are any ongoing non-coherent DMA operations in a KVM instance by examining the non-coherent DMA count.

7. The last six lines export the tracepoint symbols, which can be used for debugging and performance analysis purposes.
