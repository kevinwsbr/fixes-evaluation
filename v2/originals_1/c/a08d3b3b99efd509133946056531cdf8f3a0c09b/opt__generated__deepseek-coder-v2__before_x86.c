 These functions and macros are part of the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) virtualization infrastructure, specifically related to handling asynchronous page faults (APF). Here's a brief overview of each function and macro:

1. **`kvm_make_request(KVM_REQ_APF_HALT, vcpu)`**: This function is used to make a request for APF halt on the specified `vcpu`. It signals that an asynchronous page fault has occurred and requires further handling.

2. **`kvm_arch_async_page_present(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu, struct kvm_async_pf *work)`**: This function handles the event where a previously requested async page present (APF) condition is now ready to be handled. It checks if KVM_ASYNC_PF_ENABLED is set and whether the page is ready for user access without needing further action.

3. **`kvm_arch_can_inject_async_page_present(struct kkv_vcpu *vcpu)`**: This function determines if an async page present event can be injected into the specified `vcpu`. It returns true if KVM_ASYNC_PF_ENABLED is not set or if reinjection conditions are met, ensuring that the injection is possible under specific circumstances.

4. **`kvm_arch_register_noncoherent_dma(struct kvm *kvm)`**: This function registers non-coherent DMA for a `kvm` instance by incrementing the `noncoherent_dma_count`.

5. **`kvm_arch_unregister_noncoherent_dma(struct kvm *kvm)`**: This function unregisters non-coherent DMA for a `kvm` instance by decrementing the `noncoherent_dma_count`.

6. **`kvm_arch_has_noncoherent_dma(struct kvm *kvm)`**: This function checks if any non-coherent DMA is registered for the specified `kvm` instance by reading the `noncoherent_dma_count`.

7. **`EXPORT_*` macros**: These are used to export tracepoints and symbols from the KVM module, making them available for use in other parts of the system or for debugging purposes.

These functions collectively manage the handling of asynchronous page faults within a virtual machine running under KVM. They ensure that the virtualization layer correctly responds to hardware events related to missing pages (asynchronous page faults) by either halting processing until the required page is present or directly injecting a page fault if the condition allows it. The DMA registration and unregistration functions are crucial for managing memory access patterns within the virtual machine, ensuring proper isolation between guest OSes and the host system's memory management units.
