**Purpose:**

The code snippet you provided is part of the kernel-level Virtual Machine (VM) framework for the x86 architecture. It handles asynchronous page faults and interrupt handling for the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) framework.

**Key Functions:**

* **kvm_arch_async_page_not_present:**
    * Injects a page fault when a page is not present.
    * Updates the APF (Asynchronous Page Fault) state and injects a page fault if necessary.
* **kvm_arch_async_page_present:**
    * Injects a page ready notification when a page is present.
    * Updates the APF state and injects a page ready notification if necessary.
* **kvm_arch_can_inject_async_page_present:**
    * Determines if it is possible to inject a page ready notification.
* **kvm_arch_register_noncoherent_dma:**
    * Increments a counter for noncoherent DMA operations.
* **kvm_arch_unregister_noncoherent_dma:**
    * Decrements a counter for noncoherent DMA operations.
* **kvm_arch_has_noncoherent_dma:**
    * Checks if there are any active noncoherent DMA operations.

**Tracing:**

The code includes tracing points for various events, such as page faults, APF state changes, and interrupts.

**Tracepoint Symbols:**

The code exports tracepoint symbols for the traced events, allowing for easy debugging and analysis.

**Usage:**

The code is part of the KVM framework and is used to handle asynchronous page faults and interrupt handling for x86 VMs.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code uses the x86_exception struct to represent page faults.
* The KVM_ASYNC_PF_ENABLED bit in the APF state determines if asynchronous page faults are enabled.
* The code assumes the use of the KVM_MP_STATE_RUNNABLE state to indicate that the VM is runnable.
