 The code provided is a function that converts an input string to its equivalent in CapRTL character set, which is used for testing with the reference implementation of a bidirectional text algorithm. The function takes an input string and an output buffer as arguments, and it iterates through each character in the input string. Depending on the type of the character (determined using the `fribidi_get_bidi_type` function), it appends the corresponding CapRTL escape sequence to the output buffer. If the character is not a valid CapRTL character, it appends a question mark to the output buffer instead. The function returns the length of the output string.

   The code also includes a `fribidi_char_set_desc_cap_rtl` function that generates a description of the CapRTL character set and its escape sequences. This description is returned as a static string, which is generated only once and cached for subsequent calls to the function.
