 
This code defines a few kernel functions and variables related to performance events:

* `perf_event_init`: initializes the performance event subsystem. It registers the `pmu` bus and allocates resources for each registered PMU.
* `perf_event_sysfs_show`: shows the current value of a performance counter.
* `__init perf_event_sysfs_init`: initializes the performance event sysfs interface. It is called during kernel boot.
* `__cgroup_subsys_state *perf_cgroup_css_alloc(struct cgroup_subsys_state *parent_css)`: allocates a new `cgroup_subsys` state for performance events.
* `void perf_cgroup_css_free(struct cgroup_subsys_state *css)`: frees the allocated memory for a `cgroup_subsys` state.
* `__perf_cgroup_move(void *info)`: moves the task to a new cgroup and updates the performance counter accordingly.
* `void perf_cgroup_attach(struct cgroup_subsys_state *css, struct cgroup_taskset *tset)`: attaches tasks to the performance event cgroup. It calls `__perf_cgroup_move` for each task in the `cgroup_taskset`.
* `struct cgroup_subsys perf_event_cgrp_subsys`: defines the subsystem for performance events in a cgroup. It contains functions for allocating and freeing memory, attaching tasks to the cgroup, and moving tasks to/from the cgroup.
