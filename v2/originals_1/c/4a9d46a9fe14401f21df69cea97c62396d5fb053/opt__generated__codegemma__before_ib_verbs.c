**Purpose:**

The code snippet provides functions for managing user contexts (UContexts) in a BNXT-based IB device. It includes functions for allocating and deallocating UContexts, as well as a helper function for remapping virtual memory.

**Key Features:**

* **bnxt_re_alloc_ucontext()**: Allocates a new UContext for an IB device.
* **bnxt_re_dealloc_ucontext()**: Deallocates a UContext for an IB device.
* **bnxt_re_mmap()**: Helper function to map virtual memory from user applications.

**Functionality:**

**bnxt_re_alloc_ucontext()**:
* Allocates a new UContext structure.
* Reserves shared memory pages for the UContext.
* Allocates a DPI (Direct Physical Interface) if needed.
* Returns the allocated UContext or an error code on failure.

**bnxt_re_dealloc_ucontext()**:
* Frees the shared memory pages used by the UContext.
* Deallocates the DPI if it was allocated.

**bnxt_re_mmap()**:
* Maps virtual memory pages from the user application into the UContext's shared memory.
* Returns 0 on success or an error code on failure.

**Usage:**

The `bnxt_re_alloc_ucontext()` function should be called to allocate a new UContext. The returned UContext should then be used in subsequent IB operations. When the UContext is no longer needed, the `bnxt_re_dealloc_ucontext()` function should be called to deallocate it.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code assumes that the `bnxt_qplib_dealloc_dpi()` function is available for deallocating DPIs.
* The `PAGE_SIZE` constant is used for memory allocation.
* The `rdev` variable is a pointer to the BNXT-based IB device.
* The `udata` parameter in the `bnxt_re_alloc_ucontext()` function represents the user data containing the UContext request.
* The `resp` structure is used to store the UContext information.
