**Purpose:**

The provided code snippet is a C header file containing functions and definitions related to AC3 (Advanced Coding for Digital Audio) header parsing. It is part of the FFmpeg media framework.

**Functionality:**

* **av_ac3_parse_header()**: Parses the header of an AC3 bitstream and extracts the bitstream ID and frame size.
* **ff_ac3_parse_header()**: Parses the header of an AC3 bitstream using bitwise operations and extracts header information such as sample rate, bit rate, channels, frame size, and service type.
* **ac3_sync()**: Synchronizes the AC3 bitstream header by checking for valid header structures and extracting header information.

**Key Points:**

* The code uses the FFmpeg GetBitContext structure for bitstream parsing.
* The `ff_ac3_parse_header()` function handles the header parsing logic.
* The `ac3_sync()` function performs header synchronization and extracts header information.
* The header information is stored in an `AC3HeaderInfo` structure.

**Usage:**

The `av_ac3_parse_header()` function can be used to extract header information from an AC3 bitstream, while the `ac3_sync()` function can be used to synchronize the bitstream header.

**Note:**

The code is only available for platforms where FFmpeg is compiled with support for AC3 decoding.

**Additional Information:**

* The `AC3HeaderInfo` structure contains information extracted from the AC3 header.
* The `AACAC3ParseContext` structure is a private data structure used by the AC3 parser.
* The `ff_aac_ac3_parse()` function is part of the AC3 parser and is responsible for parsing the bitstream.

**Conclusion:**

The code snippet provides a comprehensive set of functions and definitions for parsing AC3 bitstream headers, including header information extraction and bitstream synchronization.
