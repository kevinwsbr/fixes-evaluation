 The code provided includes several functions related to parsing AC3 and EAC3 audio headers. Here's a brief explanation of each function:

1. `avpriv_ac3_parse_header` - This function takes a pointer to an `AC3HeaderInfo` struct, a buffer containing the data, and its size as arguments. It initializes a `GetBitContext` structure using the provided buffer and size, then calls `ff_ac3_parse_header` to parse the AC3 header information from the bits in the context. The parsed header information is stored in the `AC3HeaderInfo` struct pointed to by `phdr`. If any error occurs during parsing, an appropriate error code is returned.

2. `av_ac3_parse_header` - This function takes a buffer containing AC3 data, its size, and two output pointers: one for the bitstream ID and another for the frame size. It initializes a `GetBitContext` structure using the provided buffer and size, then calls `ff_ac3_parse_header` to parse the header information from the bits in the context. The parsed bitstream ID and frame size are stored at the addresses pointed to by `bitstream_id` and `frame_size`, respectively. If any error occurs during parsing, an appropriate error code is returned.

3. `ac3_sync` - This function takes a 64-bit state value, a pointer to an `AACAC3ParseContext` struct, two output pointers for frame information, and returns the size of the AC3 frame if it finds one in the provided state value. It initializes a `GetBitContext` structure using the last six bytes of the provided state value (which should contain the AC3 header) and calls `ff_ac3_parse_header` to parse the header information from the bits in the context. If parsing is successful, the function populates the `AACAC3ParseContext` struct with various audio parameters such as sample rate, bit rate, number of channels, channel layout, samples per frame, and service type (which can be used to determine whether it's AC3 or EAC3). The function also sets two output pointers based on the parsed header information: `new_frame_start` is set if the current frame is not dependent on a previous one, and `need_next_header` is set if parsing of the next header is needed.

4. `ac3_parse_init` - This function initializes an `AACAC3ParseContext` struct for use with AC3/EAC3 parsing. It sets the `header_size` field to the size of an AC3 header (5 bytes) and assigns the `ac3_sync` function to the `sync` field of the context.

5. `ff_ac3_parser` - This is a static global variable that defines an `AVCodecParser` structure for use with FFmpeg's parsing framework. It specifies the codec IDs for AC3 and EAC3, sets the size of the private data to be used by the parser, assigns the initialization function (`ac3_parse_init`), and assigns the parsing functions (`ff_aac_ac3_parse`) and close function (`ff_parse_close`).

6. The `#else` block at the end of the code is used when AC3/EAC3 parsing support is not available in FFmpeg, and it returns an error for both `avpriv_ac3_parse_header` and `av_ac3_parse_header`.
