**Description:**

The code snippet you provided is a Python script that collects and archives sosreports from multiple nodes in a cluster. It uses a thread pool to concurrently collect sosreports from each node, up to a maximum number specified in the configuration.

**Key Features:**

* **Thread Pool:** Uses a thread pool to improve performance by collecting sosreports from multiple nodes simultaneously.
* **Node Filtering:** Allows filtering of nodes based on a list of excluded nodes.
* **Additional Data Collection:** Can collect additional data from the master node using a custom function.
* **Archive Creation:** Creates a tar archive containing all collected sosreports, logs, and configuration files.
* **Error Handling:** Catches keyboard interrupts and logs an error message before exiting.

**Code Breakdown:**

* The `_collect()` method runs the `sosreport()` function on each node.
* The `close_all_connections()` method closes SSH sessions for all connected nodes.
* The `create_cluster_archive()` method creates a tar archive of the collected sosreports and logs.
* The `cleanup()` method removes temporary files and archives.

**Usage:**

1. Configure the script with necessary parameters, including the list of nodes, archive directory, and thread count.
2. Run the script to collect and archive sosreports.

**Conclusion:**

The provided code is a comprehensive solution for collecting and archiving sosreports from multiple nodes in a cluster. It simplifies the process by leveraging multithreading and provides features such as node filtering and additional data collection.
