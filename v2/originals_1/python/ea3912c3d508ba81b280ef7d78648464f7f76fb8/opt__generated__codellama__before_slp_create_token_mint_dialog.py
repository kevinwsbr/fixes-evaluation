You've got the right idea. The `check_token_qty` method is responsible for checking whether the user has entered a valid token quantity. It does this by using the `get_amount` method of the `QLineEdit` object to get the value of the `token_qty_e` field, and then checks whether it's greater than 10^19 (which is the maximum number of tokens that can be issued in a single transaction).

If the user has entered a value greater than this threshold, the method shows a warning message to remind them that users may find it awkward to transfer large amounts. This is because each transaction output can only hold up to ~2 x 10^(19-decimals) tokens, where decimals is the number of decimal places used for the token's quantity.

In this case, since the maximum number of tokens that can be issued in a single transaction is 10^19, and each transaction output can only hold up to ~2 x 10^(19-decimals) tokens, users may find it awkward to transfer large amounts if they're trying to issue more than 2 x 10^(19-decimals) tokens per transaction.

So, the method shows a warning message to remind them of this limitation and encourage them to use smaller quantities when issuing tokens.
