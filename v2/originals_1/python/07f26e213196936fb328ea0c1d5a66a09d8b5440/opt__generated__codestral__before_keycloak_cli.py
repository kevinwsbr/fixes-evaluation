 # The above code is a command line interface (CLI) for managing clients in Keycloak, an open source identity and access management solution. Here's a brief explanation of the different commands and their functionalities:

   # 1. `create` command: This command allows the creation of a new client by taking input from standard input or a metadata file (-m option) containing XML data with the client information. The --client-name option is used to specify the name of the client being created. If no server URL is provided, the default value is 'http://localhost:8080/auth'.
   # 2. `register` command: This command registers a new client in a specific realm (-r option) using an initial access token (--initial-access-token option). The metadata for the client is obtained from a file specified with the -m option. If no server URL is provided, the default value is 'http://localhost:8080/auth'.
   # 3. `delete` command: This command deletes an existing client (-c option) in a specific realm (-r option). If no server URL is provided, the default value is 'http://localhost:8080/auth'.
   # 4. `test` command (experimental): This command performs a test operation on a specific client (-c option) in a specific realm (-r option). The purpose of this command is to facilitate testing during the development phase and may not be stable or fully functional. If no server URL is provided, the default value is 'http://localhost:8080/auth'.
   # 5. Error handling: The script includes error handling mechanisms to display appropriate messages if there are any issues with the command line arguments, connections to Keycloak, or execution of the commands themselves. If the --show-traceback option is specified, the script will print a traceback in case of errors.
   # 6. Logging configuration: The script includes a function (configure_logging) to configure logging based on the options provided. By default, it sets up a console handler and configures the log format and level. If the --verbose option is specified, it increases the log level to DEBUG; if the --quiet option is specified, it decreases the log level to WARNING.
   # 7. Admin password retrieval: The script attempts to retrieve the admin password from various sources in a specific order: a file specified with the -P option, the KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variable, and finally, command line argument (-p). If none of these sources provide a valid admin password, the script will display an error message.
   # 8. Connection to Keycloak: The script establishes connections to Keycloak using the provided server URL and TLS verification option. It creates two connections: one for anonymous access (KeycloakAnonymousConnection) and another for admin access (KeycloakAdminConnection). These connections are used for different operations based on the command specified.
   # 9. Command execution: The script executes the command specified by the user, passing the options and the appropriate connection object to the corresponding function. If there is an error during the execution of the command, the script will display an error message or a traceback if the --show-traceback option is specified.
   # 10. Exit status: The script returns an exit status based on the success or failure of the command execution. If there are no errors, it returns 0; otherwise, it returns a non-zero value.
