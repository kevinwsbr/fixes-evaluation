 The provided code snippet appears to be part of a larger JavaScript module, specifically a class or object containing methods related to query generation in a database context. This particular file is likely a module for generating SQL queries using Node.js and might be part of a library such as Sequelize (a promise-based ORM for Node.js). The code defines several utility functions that transform various inputs into conditions suitable for inclusion in a `WHERE` clause of an SQL query.

Here's a breakdown of the main functionalities provided by this snippet:

1. **escapeValue**: This function is used to handle value escaping, which involves checking if the value needs to be escaped based on whether it represents a string or not. It also applies any necessary escaping logic for strings and adjusts the format based on certain conditions such as using parentheses around values when "ANY" follows "LIKE".

2. **getWhereConditions**: This function is designed to convert various types of input (like objects, arrays, numbers, etc.) into a format that can be directly used in a `WHERE` clause. It handles different cases like Sequelize methods, plain objects for complex conditions, strings representing field names or values, and buffers which are treated as raw data.

3. **booleanValue**: This function is straightforward; it simply returns the input value without modification, implying that boolean values in SQL should be represented directly by `TRUE`/`FALSE` or `1`/`0`.

4. **Other Utility Functions**: The snippet includes other utility functions and checks like handling Sequelize methods (`_isSequelizeMethod`), checking if an input is a plain object (`Utils._.isPlainObject`), and treating arrays as logical AND operations (`Utils.canTreatArrayAsAnd`). These are helper functions to support the main functionalities described above.

5. **Module Export**: The final part of the snippet exports this module so that it can be used in other parts of an application or by external libraries.

This code is likely a part of a larger library designed to abstract database interactions, allowing developers to write complex queries with different types of conditions easily and consistently across various databases without having to worry about SQL syntax nuances.
