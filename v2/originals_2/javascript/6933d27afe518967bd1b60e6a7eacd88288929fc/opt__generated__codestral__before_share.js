 This JavaScript code is for a file sharing functionality in an application. It listens to certain events and performs actions based on those events. Here's a brief explanation of what each part does:

1. Event Listener for Expiration Date Change:
   - When the expiration date input field changes, it sends a PUT request to update the expiration date of a share with the ID `shareId`.
   - If the request is successful and there's no default expiration date enforced, it hides the `defaultExpireMessage` element.
   - If the request fails, it shows an error message as a tooltip on the expiration date input field.

2. Event Listener for Email Private Link:
   - This part is currently commented out, so I'll assume that emailing links is not supported in Gallery or not relevant to the current context. The functionality would be triggered when the user submits a form with their email and other necessary details to send a private link.

3. Event Listener for Mail Notification:
   - This part is also commented out, but it seems like it's intended to handle mail notifications for recipients of shared links. When a checkbox associated with sending a notification changes, it sends a POST request to enable or disable email notifications for the recipient.
