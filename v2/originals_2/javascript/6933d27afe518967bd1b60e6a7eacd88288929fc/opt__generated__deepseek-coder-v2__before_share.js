 The provided code snippet is a JavaScript script that handles various interactions related to sharing links and emails in a web application, specifically within the context of a file-sharing feature. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. **Error Handling for Expiration Date Change**: When the expiration date field (`#dropdown #expirationDate`) is changed, it triggers an AJAX request to update the share settings with the new expiration date. If successful, it hides any default expiration message; if not, it shows a tooltip with the error message and highlights the field.

2. **Email Sharing (Commented Out)**: The commented-out sections related to emailing links are disabled due to comments stating "Emailing links is not supported in Gallery." These sections would have handled form submission for sending email notifications about the shared link, including details like the link itself and expiration date if applicable.

3. **Mail Notification (Commented Out)**: Similarly, another commented-out section handles toggling mail notification settings via checkboxes within a list item (`<li>`). This functionality is also disabled due to the same reason: "Emailing links is not supported in Gallery."

4. **AJAX Requests**: The script uses jQuery's AJAX capabilities to send and receive data from the server without reloading the page, particularly when updating share settings or handling email operations (which are currently commented out).

5. **Tooltips and Error Handling**: Throughout the script, tooltips are used to display error messages in a user-friendly way. If an error occurs during AJAX requests (e.g., setting expiration dates), appropriate feedback is provided through these tooltips.

6. **Class and Data Attribute Management**: The script dynamically adds and removes CSS classes from elements like the expiration date field (`#dropdown #expirationDate`) to indicate whether there's a validation error or not, using methods like `.addClass('error')` and `.removeClass('error')`.

7. **Event Binding**: The script uses jQuery's `.on()` method to bind event handlers to DOM elements such as change events on the dropdown menu (`#dropdown`), submit events on the email form (`#dropdown #emailPrivateLink`), and click events on checkboxes or inputs related to mail notifications.

8. **Localization (t('core', 'Error'))**: The script uses a function `t('core', 'Error')` which likely refers to localization or translation of error messages, assuming that the application supports multiple languages by localizing strings like "Error" into different languages based on user preferences or context.

This code snippet is part of a larger JavaScript file and seems to be integrated within a web-based file management or sharing service where users can share files via links with optional expiration dates and email notifications. The commented-out sections suggest that the functionality could be expanded in future versions, but for now, it focuses on core error handling and basic interactions related to link sharing and mail notifications.
