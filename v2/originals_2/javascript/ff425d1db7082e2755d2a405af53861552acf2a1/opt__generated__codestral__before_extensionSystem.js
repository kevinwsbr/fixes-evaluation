 This script manages extensions for a software application, specifically for enabling, disabling, loading, and reloading them based on changes in settings or the session mode. Here's a breakdown of its main functions:

1. **loadExtension(extension)**: This function initializes an extension by importing it, executing any initialization code (if provided), and then setting up a state object for the extension. It also emits a signal indicating that the extension has been loaded.

2. **enableExtension(uuid)**: If an extension is not already enabled and its UUID is present in `enabledExtensions`, this function enables it by changing its state to `ENABLED` and adding it to the `extensionOrder` array (which maintains the order of enabled extensions).

3. **disableExtension(uuid)**: This function disables a specific extension by setting its state to `DISABLED` and removing it from the `extensionOrder` array.

4. **getEnabledExtensions()**: This function returns a list of UUIDs of extensions that are currently enabled, taking into account both the session mode's allowed extensions and any user-specified enabled extensions.

5. **onEnabledExtensionsChanged()**: When the settings for enabled extensions change, this function determines which extensions have been added or removed from the list, enabling or disabling them as necessary.

6. **_loadExtensions()**: This internal function is called once when initializing the extension system. It sets up listeners for changes in the enabled extensions setting and session mode's version validation settings. It also initializes `enabledExtensions` to a list of currently enabled extensions and scans for available extensions.

7. **enableAllExtensions()** and **disableAllExtensions()**: These functions enable or disable all extensions based on their current state in `enabledExtensions`.

8. **_sessionUpdated()**: When the session mode changes, this function determines whether it allows extensions. If so, it updates `enabledExtensions` and enables all extensions; otherwise, it disables all extensions.

9. **init()**: This function sets up a listener for changes to the session mode and then calls `_sessionUpdated()` to ensure that extensions are enabled or disabled as appropriate based on the initial session mode.
