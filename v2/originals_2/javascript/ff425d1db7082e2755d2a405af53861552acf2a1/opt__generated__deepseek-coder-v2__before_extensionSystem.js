 The provided code snippet is a part of an extension management system in a software environment, likely written in JavaScript or a similar language. This script handles the loading and enabling/disabling of extensions based on certain conditions and settings. Here's a breakdown of what each function does and how they interact with each other:

1. **`_loadExtensions()`**: 
   - Connects to settings changes that affect extension enablement (`ENABLED_EXTENSIONS_KEY`, `DISABLE_USER_EXTENSIONS_KEY`, `EXTENSION_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK_KEY`) to react when extensions are enabled or disabled by the user.
   - Uses an `ExtensionFinder` to scan for and load found extensions.

2. **`onEnabledExtensionsChanged()`**: 
   - Triggered whenever the settings affecting extension enablement change, it updates the list of enabled extensions (`enabledExtensions`) based on these changes.
   - Enables new extensions that were added to the settings and disables those that were removed.

3. **`_onVersionValidationChanged()`**: 
   - Responsible for reloading all extensions when their version validation status changes, but only enables them again if `Main.sessionMode.allowExtensions` is true.

4. **`enableAllExtensions()`**: 
   - Ensures that all extensions are enabled by loading and initializing them if not already done, then enabling each one found in the settings.

5. **`disableAllExtensions()`**: 
   - Disables all currently loaded extensions by reversing their order and disabling each one.

6. **`_sessionUpdated()`**: 
   - Called whenever the session mode is updated, it adjusts the enable/disable state of extensions based on whether `Main.sessionMode.allowExtensions` is true or false.

7. **`init()`**: 
   - Initializes the extension system by connecting to the session update signal and immediately calling `_sessionUpdated()` to set up the initial state.

Each function interacts with global settings, manages the enablement of extensions based on these settings, and uses various signals and properties to react dynamically to changes in the environment or user configurations. The code also includes error handling (`try-catch` blocks) for when extension initialization fails.
