**Code Breakdown:**

* **`comments.postArticle()` Function:**
    * Validates user permissions.
    * Creates a new topic with title, content, tags, and comment ID.
    * Sets the topic ID in the database for the corresponding comment.
    * Redirects the user to the comments section with a success message.

* **`comments.addLinkbackToArticle()` Function:**

**Usage:**

The code can be integrated into a Node.js application to provide a complete blog comments system. It can be used to manage comments, post articles, and link them to their respective blogs.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code assumes the presence of necessary modules such as `express`, `async`, and `db`.
* The configuration parameters for blog URLs, names, and comment IDs are stored in the `meta.config` object.
* The `user` and `groups` modules are used to check user permissions.
* The `topics` and `posts` modules are used to manage topics and posts.
