  This is a NodeBB plugin that allows users to publish articles from external blogs using the `POST /comments/publish` endpoint. The plugin provides a simple interface for users to enter the URL of an article and its title, and then saves it as a comment on NodeBB with the `blog-comments:url` metadata set to the original URL.

The `init` function is called during plugin initialization and sets up the routes for the `GET /comments/get/:id` endpoint (used by the client to retrieve comments data), the `POST /comments/reply` endpoint (used to reply to a comment), and the `POST /comments/publish` endpoint (used to publish an article from an external blog).

The plugin also defines a custom admin header link that can be used to access the admin settings for the plugin.

The `addLinkbackToArticle` function is called by the client when rendering a post and adds a "Posted from [blog name]" profile field to the post, where [blog name] is the name of the blog specified in the `meta.config['blog-comments:name']` configuration option or the first URL specified in the `meta.config['blog-comments:url']` configuration option that matches the URL of the original article.

The plugin also defines an event handler for the `post:delete` event, which is triggered when a post is deleted on NodeBB. The event handler removes any blog comments associated with the deleted post from the database.
