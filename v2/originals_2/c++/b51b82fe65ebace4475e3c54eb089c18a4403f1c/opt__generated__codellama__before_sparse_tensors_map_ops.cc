This is the code for the `TakeManySparseFromTensorsMap` op, which takes a list of sparse tensors as input and outputs a single sparse tensor containing all the elements from the input tensors.

The op first checks that all the input tensors have the same rank, and then it creates a vector of indices and values for the output sparse tensor, each element of which corresponds to an element in one of the input tensors. The shape of the output tensor is the maximum of the shapes of all the input tensors.

The op then uses `SparseTensor::Concat` to concatenate the input tensors into a single output tensor. Finally, it sets the output tensor shape and returns the indices, values, and shape as outputs.
