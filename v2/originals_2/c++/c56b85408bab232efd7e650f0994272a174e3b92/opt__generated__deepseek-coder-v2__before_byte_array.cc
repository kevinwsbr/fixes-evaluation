 The provided code snippets are part of a C++ implementation for handling byte arrays and data streams. They define methods for copying data between different sources (such as another `ByteArray`, an output stream, or an input stream) and managing the internal storage of the byte array. Here's a summary of what each method does:

1. **CopyTo(OutputStream* os)**
   - Copies the entire content of the `ByteArray` to the given `OutputStream`.
   - Calls `CopyTo(os, 0, Length())`, which copies from offset 0 to the length of the byte array.

2. **CopyTo(OutputStream* os, int32_t offset, int32_t length)**
   - Copies a specified portion of the `ByteArray` to the given `OutputStream`.
   - Uses a buffer (ByteVector b) and reads data from the `ByteArray` in chunks (`COPY_BUFFER_SIZE` at most), writing each chunk to the `OutputStream`.
   - Continues until the entire specified length is read.

3. **CopyFrom(InputStream* is, int32_t length)**
   - Reads data directly from an `InputStream` and writes it into the `ByteArray`.
   - Uses a buffer (ByteVector b) to temporarily store the data being read from the input stream.
   - Continues until the specified length is reached or there's no more data to be read from the input stream.
   - If an error occurs during writing, it throws an `IOException`.

4. **CopyFrom(InputStream* is)**
   - Reads all available data (until EOF) from the `InputStream` and writes it into the `ByteArray`.
   - Uses a buffer of size `COPY_BUFFER_SIZE` for reading from the input stream.
   - If an error occurs during writing, it throws an `IOException`.

5. **ByteArray(int32_t filled_length, int32_t storage_length, bool growable)**
   - Constructor that initializes a new `ByteArray` object with specified filled and storage lengths, and whether it is growable or not.

6. **ByteArray(int32_t filled_length, int32_t storage_length)**
   - Constructor similar to the above but defaults to non-growable (`false`).

7. **Init(int32_t filled_length, int32_t storage_length, bool growable)**
   - Helper method for initializing a `ByteArray` instance with specified lengths and growability settings.

These methods are crucial for handling data operations in the context of font libraries or any application that requires efficient byte manipulation and stream processing. The use of buffers to handle data in chunks is an optimization technique to reduce memory usage and improve performance, especially when dealing with large datasets.
