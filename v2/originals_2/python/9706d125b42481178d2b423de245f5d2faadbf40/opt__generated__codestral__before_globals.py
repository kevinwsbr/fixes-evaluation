 The code you've provided is a part of the Web2Py framework for Python, specifically related to handling sessions. Here's what each function does:

1. `_try_store_in_db(self, request, response)`: This method tries to store the session data in a database if it's configured for that and if necessary (i.e., when there are changes to the session or when the session is new). If the master application doesn't use database sessions and hasn't been explicitly added to the `db_sessions` list, it will be removed from the list. It also handles setting the session ID cookie.

2. `_try_store_in_cookie_or_file(self, request, response)`: This method decides whether to try storing the session data in a cookie or a file based on the `session_storage_type` attribute of the response object.

3. `_try_store_in_file(self, request, response)`: This method tries to store the session data in a file if it's configured for that and if necessary (i.e., when there are changes to the session). It also handles creating the session folder if it doesn't exist and locking the session file to prevent concurrent modifications.

4. `_unlock(self, response)`: This method unlocks the session file if it was locked by a previous write operation.

5. `_close(self, response)`: This method closes the session file and removes the reference from the response object. It also ensures that the session file is unlocked before closing it.

6. `pickle_session(s)`: This function is a pickler for the `Session` class, which allows the session object to be serialized and deserialized using the standard Python `pickle` module. This is necessary because the session data may contain complex objects that cannot be stored in a database or cookie as-is.
