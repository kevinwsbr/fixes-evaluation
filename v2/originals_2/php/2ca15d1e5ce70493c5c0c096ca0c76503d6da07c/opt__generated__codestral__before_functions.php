 This code contains several functions related to directory handling and size calculation in a WordPress environment. Here's a breakdown of each function:

1. `recurse_dirsize($path, $exclude = '', $max_execution_time = 0, &$directory_cache = array(), $save_cache = true)`: This function calculates the total size of files and directories in a given path, excluding specific items if provided. It also supports caching directory sizes to improve performance.

2. `invalidate_dirsize_cache($path)`: This function removes entries within the dirsize_cache for a given directory and all its parent directories.

3. `normalize_dirsize_cache_path($path)`: This function normalizes the path used in the dirsize_cache to ensure consistency and ease of lookup.

4. `is_wp_version_compatible($required)`: This function checks if the current WordPress version is compatible with a given required version.

5. `is_php_version_compatible($required)`: This function checks if the current PHP version is compatible with a given required version.

6. `wp_fuzzy_number_match($expected, $actual, $precision = 1)`: This function compares two numbers to see if they are nearly equal within a specified precision level.

These functions can be used together to manage directory sizes efficiently in various WordPress environments.
