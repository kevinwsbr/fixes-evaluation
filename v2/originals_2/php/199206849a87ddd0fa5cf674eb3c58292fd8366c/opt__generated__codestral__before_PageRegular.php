 It looks like you're looking at a part of the Contao CMS source code that deals with generating JavaScript scripts for a page layout. Here's a brief explanation of what the code does:

1. The `createFooterScripts` method takes two parameters, `$objLayout` and `$objPage`, which are objects representing a page layout and a webpage, respectively. This method is responsible for creating JavaScript scripts that will be included in the footer of the page.

2. The method initializes an empty string `$strScripts` to store the generated script tags. It also generates a nonce value using Contao's framework class for security reasons.

3. If jQuery is enabled in the layout settings, it will iterate through the templates defined in the layout and append their parsed output to `$strScripts`. After that, it adds a placeholder for dynamic scripts (`[[TL_JQUERY_$nonce]]`) which will be replaced with actual JavaScript code later.

4. The same process is repeated for MooTools, if it's enabled in the layout settings.

5. Next, it includes framework-agnostic JavaScripts defined in the layout and adds a placeholder for dynamic scripts (`[[TL_BODY_$nonce]]`) to `$strScripts`.

6. It then retrieves external JavaScript files based on their UUIDs from the database and appends script tags for these files to `$strScripts`.

7. Finally, it includes any custom JavaScript defined in the layout settings and assigns the complete `$strScripts` string to the template's `mootools` property. It also adds a function to generate JSON-LD scripts if they are available in the response context.
