 This is a PHP class for managing news entries in a database. Here's a breakdown of the methods:

1. `getNewsEntries(int $start, int $limit)`: Fetches news entries from the database based on start and limit parameters. It returns an array of news objects with properties such as ID, date, language, header, content, author name, author email, dates for activation/deactivation, link, link title, target, etc.

2. `addNewsEntry(array $data)`: Inserts a new news entry into the database based on data provided in an array. The method returns true if the insertion is successful, and false otherwise.

3. `updateNewsEntry(int $id, array $data)`: Updates an existing news entry identified by its ID with new data provided in an array. Similar to the addNewsEntry method, it returns true on success and false otherwise.

4. `deleteNews(int $id)`: Deletes a news entry from the database based on its ID. It also checks if there are comments attached to the deleted news (this functionality is currently not implemented). The method returns true on successful deletion, and false otherwise.
