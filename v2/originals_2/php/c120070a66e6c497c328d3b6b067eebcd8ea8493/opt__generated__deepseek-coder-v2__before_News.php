 The provided code snippet is part of a PHP class that manages news entries in a system, likely related to a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) or news management module. This class includes methods for adding, updating, and deleting news entries, as well as retrieving news entries. Here's an overview of each method and its functionality:

1. **`getNews()` Method:**
   - **Purpose:** Retrieves a list of news entries based on certain criteria such as active status, allowed comments, date range, etc.
   - **Parameters:** None specified in the snippet but generally would take parameters for filtering or retrieving specific news items.
   - **Returns:** An array of news entries that match the criteria.

2. **`addNewsEntry(array $data): bool` Method:**
   - **Purpose:** Adds a new news entry to the database.
   - **Parameters:** An associative array `$data` containing all necessary fields for the news entry (e.g., date, language, header, content, etc.).
   - **Returns:** A boolean value indicating success (`true`) or failure (`false`).

3. **`updateNewsEntry(int $id, array $data): bool` Method:**
   - **Purpose:** Updates an existing news entry in the database identified by `$id`.
   - **Parameters:** The ID of the news entry to update and an associative array `$data` containing updated fields.
   - **Returns:** A boolean value indicating success (`true`) or failure (`false`).

4. **`deleteNews($id): bool` Method:**
   - **Purpose:** Deletes a news entry from the database identified by `$id`.
   - **Parameters:** The ID of the news entry to delete.
   - **Returns:** A boolean value indicating success (`true`) or failure (`false`).

### Additional Notes:
- **Database Handling:** The class uses `Database::getTablePrefix()` and `Database::getDb()->query()` for database operations, which suggests that it interacts with a database where the table name might be prefixed. This is common in multi-tenant systems or when multiple applications share the same database schema.
- **Security:** Input data (like `$data['content']`, etc.) is escaped using `Database::getDb()->escape()` to prevent SQL injection attacks, which is good practice for database security.
- **Error Handling:** The methods return `false` in case of a query failure, and it's up to the caller to handle this failure (e.g., displaying an error message or taking other actions).

This class would typically be part of a larger application framework that handles all aspects of managing news items within a software system, including user interfaces for adding, modifying, and deleting content as well as retrieving it according to specified criteria.
