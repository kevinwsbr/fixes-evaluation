The `getCountries()` function returns an array of countries, where each country is represented by its two-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code and its English name. The array is based on the data provided by the United Nations Statistics Division.

Here's a breakdown of how the function works:

1. Firstly, the function loads the data from the `countries.json` file using the `file_get_contents()` function. This function reads the contents of a file into a string and returns it as a string.
2. Next, the function decodes the JSON data that was read from the file using the `json_decode()` function. This function takes a JSON encoded string and returns it as a PHP value (usually an array or object). In this case, we are interested in the `country` array inside the JSON data, so we specify `true` as the second argument to tell the function to return an associative array instead of a stdClass object.
3. The function then loops through each country in the `countries` array and creates a new associative array with the country's ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code and its English name as keys and values, respectively.
4. Finally, the function returns the newly created array of countries.

The returned array has two columns: the first column is the country's ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code (e.g., "US" for United States), and the second column is the country's English name (e.g., "United States"). The keys are used to create a dropdown menu of countries, which can be used in various applications such as forms, selects, or tables.
