This code snippet is using the Bootstrap framework to structure the HTML page. The body of the page contains a container element with a form that has several input fields, including a file upload field for uploading templates and a dropdown menu for selecting a template to download or delete.

The `<?php echo attr(CsrfUtils::collectCsrfToken()); ?>` part is used to inject the CSRF token into the HTML page, which helps prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

The script tag at the end of the code adds some JavaScript functionality to the file upload field, such as displaying the file name after selecting a file and hiding the file input button. This is done using the `custom-file` class in Bootstrap.
