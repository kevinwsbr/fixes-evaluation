 The provided code snippet is a collection of methods used in the context of querying issues within a Redmine application, specifically designed for managing and displaying issue queries in the sidebar. Here's a breakdown of what each method does:

1. **save_query_to_session(klass=IssueQuery)**:
   - This method saves the current query to the session using the class name as the key. It includes filters, columns, totalable names, group by, and sort criteria in the session data.

2. **retrieve_query_from_session(klass=IssueQuery)**:
   - This method retrieves a saved query from the session. If the query is not found in the session, it creates a new one with default or previously stored values. It also sets the project for the query if available in the session; otherwise, it defaults to the current project.

3. **query_as_hidden_field_tags(query)**:
   - Converts the given query into hidden field tags suitable for form submission. These tags include filters, columns, totalable names, group by, and sort criteria which are encoded as HTML attributes.

4. **query_hidden_sort_tag(query)**:
   - Generates a single hidden field tag for the sort criteria of the query, used in forms to maintain state between requests.

5. **sidebar_queries(klass, project)**:
   - Retrieves and returns all visible, global, or on a specific project queries, sorted by their order. This method is useful for displaying relevant queries in the sidebar.

6. **query_links(title, queries)**:
   - Generates HTML content for links to each query, with optional CSS class added if the query is currently selected. It constructs URLs based on whether it's within an issue context or not.

7. **render_sidebar_queries(klass, project)**:
   - Renders a group of queries separated by visibility (private and public). This method uses `query_links` to create HTML for each set of queries, then concatenates these into a single string that can be rendered in the view.

These methods collectively provide functionality for managing issue queries across sessions and rendering them appropriately within the Redmine application's interface, particularly in the sidebar where they are often displayed for quick access or management by users.
