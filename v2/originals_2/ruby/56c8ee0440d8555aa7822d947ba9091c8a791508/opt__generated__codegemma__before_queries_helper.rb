**Purpose:**

The provided code snippet defines a Ruby on Rails controller called `IssueController` with various methods for managing and retrieving query definitions.

**Key Functionality:**

* **`store_query` method:**
    * Stores the query definition in the session.
    * Sets the `sort` attribute of the session data based on the `@query.sort_criteria`.

* **`retrieve_query_from_session` method:**
    * Retrieves the query definition from the session based on the provided `klass`.
    * Returns the retrieved query object if found, or a new instance if not.

* **`query_as_hidden_field_tags` method:**
    * Generates hidden field tags containing the query definition.

* **`query_hidden_sort_tag` method:**
    * Generates a hidden field tag containing the sort criteria of the query.

**Usage:**

The `IssueController` methods can be used to:

* Store and retrieve query definitions in the session.
* Generate hidden field tags for query information.
* Render a list of queries in the sidebar.

**Additional Notes:**

* The `IssueQuery` class is assumed to be defined elsewhere.
* The `l()` method is used for internationalization purposes.
* The `@project` variable is assumed to be available in the controller context.

**Conclusion:**

The provided code snippet provides a comprehensive solution for managing and retrieving query definitions in a Ruby on Rails application. It enables users to save and restore query settings, which can be used to filter and search for issues.
