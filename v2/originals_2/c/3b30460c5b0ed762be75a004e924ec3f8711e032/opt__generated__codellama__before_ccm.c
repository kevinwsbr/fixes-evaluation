  This is a part of the Linux kernel source code for the Crypto API. The module registers several templates that provide various cryptographic algorithms and primitives, including CCM encryption.

The `crypto_ccm_module_init` function is called when the module is initialized, and it performs the following actions:

1. Registers a template for the `cbcmac` algorithm using the `crypto_register_template` function. This template provides a CBC-MAC encryption primitive.
2. Registers a template for the `ccm_base` algorithm using the `crypto_register_template` function. This template provides a base implementation of CCM encryption that can be used to implement other versions of CCM.
3. Registers a template for the `ccm` algorithm using the `crypto_register_template` function. This template provides an implementation of CCM that uses a specific block size and key size.
4. Registers a template for the `rfc4309` algorithm using the `crypto_register_template` function. This template provides an implementation of RFC 4309, which is an obsolete version of the CCM encryption algorithm.

The `crypto_ccm_module_exit` function is called when the module is unloaded, and it performs the following actions:

1. Unregisters the templates for the `cbcmac`, `ccm_base`, and `rfc4309` algorithms using the `crypto_unregister_template` function.

The `crypto_ccm_module_init` and `crypto_ccm_module_exit` functions are both defined in the kernel's `init.h` header file, which is included at the beginning of this code snippet. The `MODULE_LICENSE` macro is also defined in this header file, and it specifies the license under which the module is released. The `MODULE_DESCRIPTION` macro specifies a brief description of the module's functionality.

The `crypto_cbcmac_tmpl`, `crypto_ccm_base_tmpl`, and `crypto_ccm_tmpl` variables are all defined in this code snippet, and they correspond to the three templates that are registered by the `crypto_ccm_module_init` function. The `crypto_rfc4309_tmpl` variable is not defined in this code snippet, but it is defined in a separate code snippet that is also included in this file.
