 This code is written in C and it's a Linux kernel module that implements the Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) mode for cryptographic operations. The module provides functions to create and manage instances of the CCM algorithm, including initializing transformations (TFMs), setting keys, performing digests, and freeing resources.

   Here's a breakdown of the main components and their corresponding functions in this code:

   1. `struct cbcmac_desc_ctx` and `struct cbcmac_tfm_ctx` are two context structures used for CBC-MAC (CBCCM) transformations.

   2. The `cbcmac_init_tfm` function initializes a CBC-MAC transformation instance by clearing the context data. It takes a cryptographic transformation as an argument and returns 0 if successful.

   3. The `cbcmac_exit_tfm` function cleans up resources used by a CBC-MAC transformation instance after it's no longer needed.

   4. The `crypto_cbcmac_digest_init`, `crypto_cbcmac_digest_update`, and `crypto_cbcmac_digest_final` functions are responsible for performing the CBC-MAC digest operation, which involves initializing the context, updating it with data, and finalizing the calculation of the authentication tag.

   5. The `crypto_cbcmac_digest_setkey` function sets the key to be used in a CBC-MAC transformation instance. It takes a cryptographic digest as an argument and returns 0 if successful.

   6. The `cbcmac_create` function creates an instance of the CBC-MAC algorithm by allocating necessary resources and registering it with the crypto framework. If an error occurs during this process, appropriate cleanup operations are performed.

   7. `crypto_ccm_module_init` is the module initialization function that registers the CCM base template, CCM template, RFC4309 template, and CBCCM template with the kernel crypto framework if successful. In case of any errors during registration, the corresponding templates are unregistered to prevent any leaks or inconsistencies.

   8. `crypto_ccm_module_exit` is the module exit function that unregisters all the registered templates when the module is removed from the kernel.
