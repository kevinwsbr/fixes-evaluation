This is a kernel module file for the Linux operating system, which defines a framebuffer driver for VBE2.0-compliant graphics cards. The driver provides support for various configuration options, such as setting the pixel clock, horizontal and vertical frequencies, and the maximum amount of video memory to use. It also supports hardware blanking and sets up Memory Type Range Registers (MTRRs) to optimize memory usage.

The module defines several parameters that can be set using kernel command-line options or through the sysfs interface:

* `scroll`: specifies the scrolling mode, which can be one of `redraw`, `ypan`, or `ywrap`.
* `vgapal`: enables setting the palette using VGA registers.
* `pmipal`: enables setting the palette using PMI calls.
* `mtrr`: sets the MTRRs to a specific value (0 disables them).
* `blank`: enables hardware blanking.
* `nocrtc`: ignores CRTC timings when setting modes.
* `noedid`: ignores EDID-provided monitor limits when setting modes.
* `vram_remap`: sets the amount of video memory to be used (in MiB).
* `vram_total`: sets the total amount of video memory (in MiB).
* `maxclk`, `maxhf`, and `maxvf`: specify maximum pixel clock, horizontal frequency, and vertical frequency values, respectively. These values override any values provided in the EDID data.
* `mode_option`: specifies an initial video mode to set as a string of the form `<xres>x<yres>[-<bpp>][@<refresh>]`.
* `vbemode`: sets a VBE mode number to use, which overrides the `mode` option.
* `v86d`: specifies the path to the v86d userspace helper program.
