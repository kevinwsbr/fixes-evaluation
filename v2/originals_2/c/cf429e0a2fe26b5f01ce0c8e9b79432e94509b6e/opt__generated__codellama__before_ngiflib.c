This is a sample implementation of the `DecodeGif` function that decodes a GIF file and extracts its content into a data structure. The function takes a pointer to an instance of the `struct ngiflib_st` structure as input, which contains information about the GIF file being decoded.

The function first reads the signature bytes from the beginning of the GIF file and checks that they match the expected value. If they do not, it returns -1, indicating an error.

Next, the function enters a loop where it reads the next block from the GIF file. The loop terminates when it encounters a final 0x00 byte at the end of the GIF file. During each iteration of the loop, the function decodes the current block and updates the data structure accordingly.

The first few bytes of each block contain an identifier for the type of block being decoded. The function switches on this identifier to determine what action to take next. For example, if the identifier is 0x2C (indicating an image separator), the function extracts information about the current image and stores it in a `struct ngiflib_img` structure.

The function then loops over the remaining bytes in the block, decoding the data into the appropriate fields of the `struct ngiflib_img`. For example, if the block contains an image descriptor, the function extracts information about the current image's dimensions and stores it in the `struct ngiflib_img`.

Once the entire block has been decoded, the function continues to read the next block from the GIF file and repeats the process until the end of the file is reached. At this point, the function returns 1, indicating that a new image was found in the GIF file.

The `GifIndexToTrueColor` function takes a pointer to an array of `struct ngiflib_rgb` structures and an index value, and returns a true color representation of the corresponding palette entry.
