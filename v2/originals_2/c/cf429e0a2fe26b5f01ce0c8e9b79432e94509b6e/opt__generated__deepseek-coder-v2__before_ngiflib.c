 The provided code snippet is a part of a GIF decoder library named `ngiflib`. It handles the parsing and decoding of GIF files, specifically focusing on image descriptors and extension blocks. Here's a breakdown of what each section does:

1. **Main Loop through GIF Blocks**:
   - The function iterates over blocks in a GIF file using a while loop (`while (GetByte(g) >= 0)`). Each block starts with a byte indicating its type, which can be either an image descriptor or an extension block.
   
2. **Handling Different Block Types**:
   - For each block, it checks the `sign` byte to determine if it's an image descriptor (`0x2C`), a plain text extension (`0x01`), a comment extension (`0xFE`), or an application extension (`0xFF`).
   - **Image Descriptor (0x2C)**: Initializes and decodes each GIF frame. It sets up pointers to the next frames if there are multiple images in the GIF file.
   - **Plain Text Extension (0x01)** and **Comment Extension (0xFE)**: These are currently ignored or logged but could be used for text rendering or additional metadata in future versions of the application using this library.
   - **Application Extension (0xFF)**: Specifically handles Netscape looping extension by extracting loop count from its data.

3. **Extension Blocks Handling**:
   - For each type of extension block, it logs detailed information about the block content if logging is enabled (`g->log`). This includes displaying hexadecimal values and textual representations of byte arrays.

4. **Image Decoding**:
   - When an image descriptor (0x2C) is encountered, it initializes a new `ngiflib_img` structure to represent the current frame and sets up its Graphics Control Extension (`gce`) if present. It then calls `DecodeGifImg(g->cur_img)` to decode the actual image data.
   - After processing an image descriptor (indicated by reading a zero byte), it returns 1, indicating successful decoding of an image.

5. **Utility Functions**:
   - **GifIndexToTrueColor**: Converts a palette index into its corresponding true color representation using the RGB values from the provided palette. This function is crucial for converting indexed color images to a format that can be displayed directly in applications expecting full-color graphics (like modern computers).

This code snippet demonstrates how to parse and interpret GIF file structures, handling both standard image data and optional metadata such as extensions which provide additional information about how the frames should be handled or displayed.
