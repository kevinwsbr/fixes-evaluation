 This is a function that takes in a pointer to an array of `ngiflib_rgb` structures and an unsigned byte value, then returns an unsigned integer. The function is meant to convert a GIF index into a true color value by using the corresponding RGB values from the palette for the given index. The returned value is a combination of the blue, green, and red components of the color in a single 32-bit integer.
