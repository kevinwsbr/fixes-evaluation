**Introduction**

The code snippet you provided implements readlink and symlink operations for a page-based file system. It provides functions for reading symbolic links, getting link contents into pagecache, and managing link references.

**Key Functions:**

* **generic_readlink:** Reads the target of a symbolic link.
* **page_getlink:** Gets the link contents into pagecache.
* **page_readlink:** Reads the target of a symbolic link from pagecache.
* **page_follow_link_light:** Follows a symbolic link and returns the target page.
* **page_put_link:** Releases the resources associated with a page-based link.
* **page_symlink:** Creates a new symbolic link in pagecache.

**Implementation Details:**

* The `generic_readlink` function follows the symbolic link using the `follow_link()` method provided by the inode operations.
* The `page_getlink` function reads the link contents into a page in pagecache.
* The `page_readlink` function retrieves the link target from pagecache.
* The `page_follow_link_light` function creates a nameidata object and sets the link target to the page obtained from `page_getlink`.
* The `page_put_link` function releases the page associated with the link.
* The `page_symlink` function writes the symbolic link target to pagecache.

**Usage:**

The functions can be used to implement symbolic link operations for a page-based file system. The `page_symlink_inode_operations` structure can be used to register the operations with the inode.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code assumes the use of pagecache for storing link contents.
* The `__GFP_FS` flag is used to determine if the file system supports page-based symlinks.
* The `mapping_gfp_mask()` function is used to get the GFP mask for the file system.

**Conclusion**

The code provides a comprehensive set of functions for implementing page-based symbolic link operations. It simplifies the process of creating and managing symbolic links in a page-based file system.
