 The code provided is a part of the Linux kernel's filesystem operations related to reading and handling symbolic links (symlinks). Here's an overview and explanation of each function and its role within this context:

1. **`generic_readlink`**:
   - This function reads the contents of a symlink at a given `dentry`.
   - It initializes a `nameidata` structure, follows the symlink using the inode operation's `follow_link`, and then reads the link content into the provided buffer.
   - If the inode operation has a `put_link` function, it calls this after reading the link to release any resources associated with following the link.

2. **`page_getlink`**:
   - This function retrieves the contents of a symlink stored in pagecache for a given `dentry`.
   - It reads the mapping page from the inode's address space, maps it into kernel space, and then copies the content to ensure it fits within the specified buffer size.

3. **`page_readlink`**:
   - This function reads the contents of a symlink stored in pagecache into a user-space buffer.
   - It uses `page_getlink` to get the link content, then copies it to the user buffer and releases any associated pages.

4. **`page_follow_link_light`**:
   - This function is used for lightweight following of symlinks when no transaction context is available.
   - It sets the link in `nameidata` using `page_getlink` and returns the page containing the symlink target.

5. **`page_put_link`**:
   - This function releases a previously retrieved link page by unmapping it and marking it for release from the page cache.

6. **`__page_symlink`**:
   - This function creates a new symbolic link (symlink) in the kernel's pagecache, using the inode operations.
   - It writes the symlink content into the specified range of the inode's address space and marks the inode as dirty once completed.

7. **`page_symlink`**:
   - This function is a wrapper for `__page_symlink`, determining whether to use pagecache based on filesystem-related flags.

8. **`page_symlink_inode_operations`**:
   - This structure defines the default inode operations for inodes that represent symbolic links, providing implementations for readlink, following links, and releasing links using the functions defined above.

These functions collectively handle the reading and writing of symlink contents in a kernel where performance is crucial, especially when dealing with large or remote filesystems, by leveraging pagecache to minimize direct I/O operations.
