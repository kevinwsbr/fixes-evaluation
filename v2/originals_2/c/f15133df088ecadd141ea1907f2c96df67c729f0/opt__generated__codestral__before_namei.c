 The provided code is a collection of functions related to symbolic links in the Linux kernel's VFS (Virtual File System) layer. Symbolic links are special types of files that contain a reference to another file or directory. Here's an overview of what each function does:

1. `generic_readlink(struct dentry *dentry, char __user *buffer, int buflen)`: This function is used to read the contents of a symbolic link into a user-space buffer. It handles error checking and invokes the necessary functions based on whether the underlying file system has its own `put_link` operation or not.

2. `page_getlink(struct dentry *dentry, struct page **ppage)`: This function retrieves the contents of a symbolic link from the page cache. It reads the first page of the inode's address space and maps it into kernel memory using `kmap`. If successful, it returns the kernel virtual address of the mapped page; otherwise, it returns an error pointer.

3. `page_readlink(struct dentry *dentry, char __user *buffer, int buflen)`: This function is a wrapper around `page_getlink` that reads the contents of a symbolic link into a user-space buffer and releases the page cache mapping when done.

4. `page_follow_link_light(struct dentry *dentry, struct nameidata *nd)`: This function retrieves the target of a symbolic link from the page cache and stores it in the provided `nameidata` structure. It returns a pointer to the mapped page that should be passed to `page_put_link` when done.

5. `page_put_link(struct dentry *dentry, struct nameidata *nd, void *cookie)`: This function releases a page cache mapping obtained by `page_follow_link_light`. It takes the cookie returned by that function as an argument and frees any resources associated with it.

6. `__page_symlink(struct inode *inode, const char *symname, int len, int nofs)`: This function creates a new symbolic link by writing its contents to the page cache. The `nofs` argument specifies whether the file system supports writeback operations or not.

7. `page_symlink(struct inode *inode, const char *symname, int len)`: This is a wrapper around `__page_symlink` that determines the appropriate value for the `nofs` argument based on the underlying file system's capabilities.

8. `page_symlink_inode_operations`: This structure contains pointers to the relevant functions for handling symbolic link inodes, which can be used as a base for file systems that support symbolic links.
