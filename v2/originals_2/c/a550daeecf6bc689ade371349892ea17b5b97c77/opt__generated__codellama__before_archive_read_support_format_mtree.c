This is an example of a function that reads a line from the input stream and returns its length, including the newline character, or negative on error. The function uses an `archive_string` structure to store the read line. The `mtree` structure contains various information about the current mtree file being parsed.

The function starts by reading one byte from the input stream using `__archive_read_ahead`. If the read fails or returns a negative value, it returns an error code. Otherwise, it continues reading bytes until the end of the line is reached, which is indicated by a newline character (`\n`). The function checks for escaped newlines (`\\n`) and skips them.

The `archive_string_ensure` function is used to ensure that there is enough space in the `mtree->line` string buffer to hold the read line. If this fails, an error code is returned. Otherwise, the read bytes are appended to the `mtree->line` string, and the newline character is added at the end.

The function returns the length of the read line, including the newline character, or negative on error. The `start` argument is updated to point to the first character of the read line.
