 This code is a part of a program that likely handles file transfer over a network using the Secure Copy (SCP) protocol. Here's a brief explanation of what each function does:

1. `run_err`: This function prints an error message to a specified output stream and, if not running remotely, also prints it to standard error. The error message is formatted using the provided format string and variable arguments.

2. `note_err`: This function is used to note errors that occur during file transfer. It stores the first-noted error and returns -1 if an error has been noted. If called with a null argument, it replays any previously-noted error.

3. `verifydir`: This function checks whether the given path is a directory. If not, it prints an error message and exits.

4. `okname`: This function checks if a given string can be a valid user name. It iterates over each character in the string, checking that it's alphanumeric or certain special characters are not present.

5. `allocbuf`: This function allocates memory for a buffer used for reading data from a file descriptor. The size of the buffer is determined based on the block size of the file system or defaults to a specified block size if that information is unavailable.

6. `lostconn`: This function handles the loss of connection during file transfer. If not running remotely, it prints an error message to standard error and then exits with a status code of 1.
