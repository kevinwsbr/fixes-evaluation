  This code defines several functions used throughout the implementation of the scp program. The functions are:
  
* `run_err`: prints an error message to stderr and sets the return value of the main function to a non-zero value, indicating that there was an error.
* `vfprintf`: a variant of fprintf that allows for formatted printing with variable arguments.
* `vasnmprintf`: a variant of vasnprintf that does not allocate memory dynamically but instead uses a predefined buffer of maximum size.
* `note_err`: saves an error message to be printed at the end of the program if it is not already set.
* `verifydir`: verifies that the specified directory exists and is a directory, otherwise prints an error message and terminates the program.
* `okname`: checks whether the specified string is a valid user name, returns 1 if so, or 0 otherwise.
* `allocbuf`: allocates a buffer with the specified block size if it has not already been allocated with that size, or increases its size to accommodate the specified block size.
* `lostconn`: terminates the program with an error message and a non-zero exit value if the connection is lost while transferring data.

The functions are used throughout the implementation of the scp program for handling errors, formatting output, verifying directory structure, validating user input, allocating buffers, and handling disconnections.
