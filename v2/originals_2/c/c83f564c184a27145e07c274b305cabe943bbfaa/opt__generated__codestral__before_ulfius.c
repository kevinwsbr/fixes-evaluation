 The provided code contains several functions related to URL encoding and decoding, as well as global initialization and cleanup for a library. Here's a brief explanation of each function:

1. `For_encode(const char *str)`: This function takes a string as input and returns a new string that is URL-encoded. It allocates memory for the encoded string, iterates through each character in the input string, and encodes it according to certain rules (like converting spaces to '+' and encoding non-alphanumeric characters using percent encoding).

2. `ulfius_url_decode(const char *str)`: This function takes a URL-encoded string as input and returns a new string that is URL-decoded. It allocates memory for the decoded string, iterates through each character in the input string, and decodes it according to certain rules (like converting '+' back to spaces and decoding percent-encoded characters).

3. `ulfius_global_init(void)`: This function initializes global settings for a library. It retrieves custom memory allocation functions using `o_get_alloc_funcs()`, and then it initializes CURL (if not disabled) and sets the memory allocation functions for Jansson JSON library (if not disabled).

4. `ulfius_global_close(void)`: This function cleans up any global resources that were initialized in `ulfius_global_init()`. In this case, it calls `curl_global_cleanup()` to clean up CURL-related resources.

Overall, the code appears to be a part of a library or framework that provides functionality for URL encoding and decoding, as well as some global initialization and cleanup functions.
