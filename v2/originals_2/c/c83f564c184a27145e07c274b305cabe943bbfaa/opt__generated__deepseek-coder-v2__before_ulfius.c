 The provided code snippets are from a C library, likely related to web server or client functionality. Let's break down each function and its purpose:

1. **ulfius_url_encode**: This function takes a string `str` and returns its URL-encoded version. It handles alphanumeric characters, spaces (replacing them with '+'), and other special characters by converting them to their hexadecimal representation preceded by '%'. The encoded string is dynamically allocated and should be freed after use.

2. **ulfius_url_decode**: This function takes a URL-encoded string `str` and returns its decoded version. It converts percent-encoded sequences back to their original characters. If the input contains spaces, they are converted back to regular spaces from '+'. The decoded string is dynamically allocated and should be freed after use.

3. **ulfius_global_init**: This function initializes global resources for the library. It sets up memory allocation functions (malloc, realloc, free), initializes cURL if not disabled, and sets up JSON allocation functions if JSON support is enabled. If any of these steps fail, it logs an error message and returns an appropriate status code.

4. **ulfius_global_close**: This function cleans up global resources when the library is no longer needed. It shuts down cURL if not disabled.

Here's a summary of each function:

- `ulfius_url_encode`: URL encodes a given string.
  - Parameters: `const char * str` - The input string to be encoded.
  - Returns: A dynamically allocated string containing the URL-encoded version of the input, or NULL if the input is NULL.
  
- `ulfius_url_decode`: URL decodes a given string.
  - Parameters: `const char * str` - The input string to be decoded.
  - Returns: A dynamically allocated string containing the decoded version of the input, or NULL if the input is NULL.
  
- `ulfius_global_init`: Initializes global resources for the library, including memory allocation functions and optional features like cURL and JSON support.
  - Returns: An integer status code indicating success (U_OK) or failure (U_ERROR, U_ERROR_MEMORY).
  
- `ulfius_global_close`: Cleans up global resources when they are no longer needed.

These functions are useful for encoding and decoding URLs in a web application context, ensuring that data can be safely transmitted over the internet without being mangled by special characters or spaces.
