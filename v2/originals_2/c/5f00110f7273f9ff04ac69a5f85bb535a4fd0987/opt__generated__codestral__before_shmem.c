 This is a collection of functions from the Linux kernel source code, specifically for handling shared memory files and their associated operations.

1. `shmem_file_setup`: This function sets up a new shared memory file with a given name, size, and flags. It creates a new dentry (directory entry) in the filesystem, allocates an inode for the file, initializes some metadata, and returns a file structure that can be used to perform operations on the file. If there are any errors during this process, it cleans up the allocated resources and returns an error code.
2. `shmem_zero_setup`: This function sets up a shared anonymous mapping for a virtual memory area (VMA). It creates a new file backed by the "/dev/zero" device with a size equal to the VMA's range, allocates a file structure for it, and initializes some metadata. The VMA is then associated with this file and a set of shared memory operations are configured for it.
3. `shmem_read_mapping_page_gfp`: This function reads a page from a given address space into the page cache using a specified allocation flag. It's used to handle shared memory pages that may be in swapcache, which can't be read using the traditional `read_cache_page_gfp` method. The function takes an address space, a page index, and a page allocator flags argument, and returns a pointer to the page if it was successfully read into the cache. If there were any errors during the process, it returns an error code wrapped in a `ERR_PTR`.
