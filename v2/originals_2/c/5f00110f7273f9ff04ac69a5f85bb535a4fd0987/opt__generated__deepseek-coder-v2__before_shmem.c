 These functions are part of the Linux kernel's shared memory management implementation for tmpfs (Transparent Shared Memory) and shmem (SHared Malloc). They handle the setup and manipulation of shared anonymous mappings, which are used to provide a file-backed virtual memory interface without requiring an actual backing file. Here's a brief explanation of each function:

1. **shmem_file_setup**: This function is used to create a new file with a specified size in the tmpfs filesystem. It initializes a file structure and allocates space for it, setting up its metadata (inode) and data (file contents). The file is created as an anonymous file, meaning it does not correspond directly to any real storage media but uses virtual memory instead.

2. **shmem_zero_setup**: This function sets up a mapping area (`vm_area_struct`) for reading from `/dev/zero`. It creates a new file with the size of the mapping area and maps it to this area, allowing reads from `/dev/zero` which returns zeros. The `vma->vm_file` is set to the newly created file, and the memory operations are hooked up to `shmem_vm_ops`.

3. **shmem_read_mapping_page_gfp**: This function reads a page from the given address space (which typically represents a tmpfs or shmem filesystem mapping) into the page cache using specified GFP flags for allocation. It uses `shmem_getpage_gfp` to retrieve the page, which is then returned after unlocking it. If there's an error in retrieving the page, it returns an ERR_PTR with the corresponding error code.

These functions are particularly useful in scenarios where a kernel module or application needs to manage memory-mapped files without the overhead of traditional file systems. They provide a way to create and manipulate shared, anonymous mappings that behave like regular files but reside entirely within virtual memory.
