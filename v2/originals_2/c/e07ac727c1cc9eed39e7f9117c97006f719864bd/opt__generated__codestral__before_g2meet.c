 The provided code is a video decoder implementation for the Go2Meeting (G2M) format. Here's a brief explanation of its structure and functionality:

1. `G2MContext` Structure: This structure holds all context information required for decoding G2M frames. It includes variables such as width, height, tiles_x, tiles_y, cursor coordinates, frame buffer pointers, etc.

2. `g2m_decode_frame` Function: This function takes an input packet and decodes it into a picture. It handles the parsing of G2M chunks (e.g., header chunk, map chunk, data chunk) to extract information like cursor coordinates and frame data. Depending on the chunk type, it performs appropriate actions such as setting up the cursor shape or updating the frame buffer with tile data. Finally, it paints the cursor onto the frame and sets up the AVFrame for output.

3. `g2m_decode_init` Function: This function initializes the G2M decoder context by setting up a JPEG context using the `jpg_init` function from libavcodec. It also sets the pixel format to RGB24.

4. `g2m_decode_end` Function: This function frees allocated memory and cleans up resources used during decoding, such as the JPEG context and frame buffer.

5. Codec Registration: The code registers the G2M decoder with FFmpeg by defining an `AVCodec` structure for it, including its name, long name, type, ID, private data size, initialization, close, decode functions, and capabilities (e.g., CODEC_CAP_DR1).

In summary, this code provides a complete implementation of a G2M video decoder using FFmpeg's libavcodec library. It can handle the parsing of G2M chunks, cursor painting, and frame buffer updating to produce decoded video frames.
