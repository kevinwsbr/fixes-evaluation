**Purpose**

The provided code snippet defines a set of functions and symbols for the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) architecture. These functions provide various functionalities related to interrupts, device assignment, and memory management in KVM virtual machines.

**Functions**

* **kvm_arch_has_assigned_device:** Checks if a virtual machine has assigned devices.
* **kvm_arch_register_noncoherent_dma:** Increments a counter for non-coherent DMA operations.
* **kvm_arch_unregister_noncoherent_dma:** Decrements a counter for non-coherent DMA operations.
* **kvm_arch_has_noncoherent_dma:** Returns the current value of the non-coherent DMA counter.
* **kvm_arch_irq_bypass_add_producer:** Adds an IRQ bypass producer.
* **kvm_arch_irq_bypass_del_producer:** Deletes an IRQ bypass producer.
* **kvm_arch_update_irqfd_routing:** Updates IRQ routing settings.

**Tracepoints**

The code exports tracepoints for various KVM events, including:

* KVM exit
* Fast MMIO access
* Interrupt injection
* Page fault
* MSR (Model-Specific Register) access
* CR (Control Register) access
* Nested VM run
* Nested VM exit
* Nested VM exit injection
* Nested interrupt VM exit
* INVLPG (Invalidate Processor Local GTL) operation
* SKINIT event
* Nested intercepts
* TSC (Time Stamp Counter) offset write
* PLE (Performance Local Event) window
* PML (Page Modification Logging) full
* PI/SC (Performance Interrupt/Supplemental Control) update

**Exports**

The code exports the functions and tracepoints as kernel symbols using the `EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL` macro.

**Usage**

These functions and tracepoints can be used by KVM drivers and other modules to interact with virtual machine interrupts, device assignments, and memory management.

**Additional Notes**

* The code is specific to the KVM architecture.
* The functions and tracepoints may have additional dependencies or restrictions.
* The code may need to be adapted or modified depending on the specific KVM implementation or kernel version.
