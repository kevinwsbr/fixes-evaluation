**Image Encoding Process:**

The provided code snippet outlines the image encoding process for the YUV (Yellow, U, V) color space. The process involves the following steps:

**1. Image Conversion:**
- The input image is converted to the YUV color space.
- The Y channel represents the luminance, while the U and V channels represent the chrominance.

**2. Chroma Subsampling:**
- The U and V channels are subsampled to reduce the amount of data required to represent the color variations.
- The U and V channels are interleaved, with each pixel in the U and V channels corresponding to two pixels in the original image.

**3. Data Compression:**
- The Y, U, and V channels are encoded separately.
- Each channel is compressed using a lossless compression algorithm, such as Huffman coding.

**4. Blob Writing:**
- The compressed Y, U, and V channels are written to separate blobs in the image file.
- The image header contains information about the compression algorithm used and the dimensions of the original image.

**Key Points:**

- The code uses the `ScaleQuantumToChar()` and `ScaleQuantumToShort()` functions to convert quantum values to bytes or shorts.
- The `WriteBlobByte()` and `WriteBlobShort()` functions are used to write data to the image blobs.
- The `PartitionInterlace` interlacing scheme is used to reduce the amount of data required to store the image.

**Usage:**

The `WriteImage()` function can be used to encode an image in the YUV color space to an image file. The function takes the following arguments:

- `image_info`: An `ImageInfo` structure containing the image settings.
- `image`: The image to encode.
- `exception`: A pointer to an `ExceptionInfo` structure for error handling.

**Note:**

- The code assumes that the `yuv_image` and `chroma_image` images are already created and initialized.
- The `AppendImageFormat()` function is used to set the image format to YUV.
- The `SetImageProgress()` function is used to report the progress of the image encoding process.
