**tdirmaketnode() Function:**

The `tdirmaketnode()` function creates a new directory or file in a temporary file system.

**Parameters:**

* `dir`: Pointer to the parent directory.
* `tm`: Pointer to the temporary mount.
* `va`: Pointer to the vattr structure containing the file/directory attributes.
* `op`: Operation type (DE_CREATE or DE_MKDIR).
* `newnode`: Pointer to a new tmpnode pointer where the created node will be stored.
* `cred`: Pointer to the credential object.

**Steps:**

1. **Validate Input:** Ensure that the `va` parameter is not NULL and the operation type is either DE_CREATE or DE_MKDIR.
2. **Handle Timeoverflow:** Check if the `va_atime` or `va_mtime` timestamps are overflowing. If so, return an `EOVERFLOW` error.
3. **Create New Node:** Allocate a new `tmpnode` structure and initialize it with the attributes specified in `va`.
4. **Set Device and Type:** Set the `tn_rdev` and `tn_vnode->v_type` fields based on the file type (VBLK or VCHR) or regular file.
5. **Determine Group ID:** Calculate the group ID based on the options specified in `va` or the parent directory's group ID.
6. **Set File Permissions:** Set the set-GID bit if the parent directory has it set and the file is a directory. Otherwise, clear the set-GID bit if the user is not privileged or a member of the new group.
7. **Set Timestamps:** Set the `tn_atime` and `tn_mtime` fields based on the values in `va`.
8. **Initialize Directory:** If the operation is DE_MKDIR, call `tdirinit()` to initialize the directory.
9. **Return Success:** Set the `newnode` pointer to the newly created node and return 0 to indicate success.

**Note:**

* The function handles extended attributes by setting the `ISXATTR` flag in the `tn_flags` field.
* It uses the `secpolicy_vnode_create_gid()` function to determine the group ID if the `AT_GID` attribute is set.
* The set-GID bit is only set on directories.
