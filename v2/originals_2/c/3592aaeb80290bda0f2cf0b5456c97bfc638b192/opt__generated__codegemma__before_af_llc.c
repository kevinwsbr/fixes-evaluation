**Module Name:** llc2

**Description:**

The llc2 module provides support for the IEEE 802.2 Logical Link Control (LLC) protocol in the Linux kernel. It allows for communication over LLC-based networks, such as Ethernet.

**Key Features:**

- Implements the LLC protocol stack, including the LLC header, trailer, and checksum.
- Provides functions for creating, binding, connecting, accepting, and sending/receiving data over LLC connections.
- Handles LLC packets and performs necessary actions based on the packet type.
- Registers the LLC protocol with the kernel and creates the necessary network family and socket operations.

**Module Initialization and Exit:**

- The `llc2_init()` function initializes the module, registers the LLC protocol, sets up the LLC handlers, and initializes the LLC station.
- The `llc2_exit()` function tears down the module, releases resources, and unregisters the LLC protocol.

**Usage:**

- The LLC protocol can be used by applications to communicate over LLC-based networks.
- The `llc_send()` and `llc_recv()` functions can be used to send and receive data over LLC connections.

**Error Handling:**

- The module logs errors to the kernel log in case of failures during initialization, configuration, or packet handling.

**Dependencies:**

- The `linux/net.h` header file provides the necessary networking functionalities.
- The `llc_station.c` module provides support for the LLC station.

**Module License:**

- GPLv2 or later

**Module Aliases:**

- pf_llc

**Conclusion:**

The llc2 module provides a complete implementation of the IEEE 802.2 LLC protocol in the Linux kernel, enabling applications to communicate over LLC-based networks.
