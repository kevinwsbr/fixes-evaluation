 This is a kernel module for Linux that provides IEEE 802.2 Logical Link Control (LLC) protocol family support. It includes functionality for creating and managing LLC sockets, binding to local SAP (Service Access Point) addresses, connecting to remote SAP addresses, sending and receiving data over LLC connections, setting and getting socket options, and handling IOCTL operations. The module also registers a network family with the kernel for use by applications. When the module is loaded, it registers an LLC protocol and initializes various data structures and resources required for its operation. When the module is unloaded, it releases these resources and de-registers the LLC protocol.
