This is a C implementation of the MATLAB file format, which is used to store matrices in a compact binary form. The `WriteMATImage` function takes an image and an image information object as arguments and saves the image to a file using the MAT file format.

The first thing this function does is transform the image's colorspace to sRGBColorspace, which is necessary because MATLAB assumes that images are in the sRGB colorspace. Then it sets the image to grayscale if it is not already grayscale. Finally, it calculates the size of the data section and writes out the header information for the file.

The main loop of this function iterates over each pixel of the input image, converts it to a quantum type using `ExportQuantumPixels`, and then writes out the pixels using `WriteBlob`. The padding is calculated and written at the end of the data section.

The use of `QuantumInfo` structure and `GetQuantumPixels` function are used to convert each pixel to a quantum type and retrieve its values, respectively.
