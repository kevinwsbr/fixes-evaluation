  This code defines a Netlink family for the cfg80211 module in Linux. The family is called `nl80211` and has several operations that correspond to different types of messages that can be sent over this family.

The family is defined using the following structures:

* `struct nl80211_ops`: This structure defines a set of operations that are supported by the `nl80211` family. The operations are responsible for handling incoming Netlink messages and translating them into cfg80211 calls.
* `struct genl_family`: This structure defines the overall family of operations, including its name, ID, and version number.
* `struct genl_multicast_group`: This structure defines a multicast group within the `nl80211` family. Multicast groups allow multiple Netlink sockets to be notified when messages are received in the same way that unicast sockets do. In this case, the `nl80211_config_mcgrp`, `nl80211_scan_mcgrp`, and `nl80211_regulatory_mcgrp` multicast groups are used to notify multiple Netlink sockets when a new device is added, a scan results in new information being available, or the regulatory domain changes.
* `struct notifier_block`: This structure defines a notification block that can be used to handle incoming Netlink messages. The `nl80211_netlink_notifier` notifier block is registered with the Netlink subsystem and receives notifications when new devices are added or removed, or when the regulatory domain changes.
* `struct netlink_notify`: This structure defines a notification that can be used to notify other Netlink sockets of changes in the `nl80211` family.

The `nl80211_init()` function initializes the `nl80211` family by registering it with the Netlink subsystem and its operations, as well as registering multicast groups for config, scan, and regulatory changes. The `netlink_register_notifier()` function is called to register the notifier block that will receive notifications when new devices are added or removed, or when the regulatory domain changes.

The `nl80211_exit()` function exits the `nl80211` family by unregistering it with the Netlink subsystem and its operations, as well as unregistering multicast groups for config, scan, and regulatory changes. The `netlink_unregister_notifier()` function is called to remove the notifier block that was registered with the Netlink subsystem.
