This method is a more efficient implementation of `StrokePolygon` that uses the `stroke_polygon` array to store the points of the stroked polygon, rather than creating and destroying individual point arrays. The `stroke_p` and `stroke_q` arrays are used as temporary storage for the points in the input polygon, and then copied into the `stroke_polygon` array.

The main difference between this method and `StrokePolygon` is that it does not create separate arrays for the input polygon points and the stroked points, which saves memory and makes the code more efficient. The `CheckPathExtent` function is also used to check if the stroke would exceed the maximum size of the path, and if so, an error is thrown.

Overall, this method provides a more efficient implementation of the stroke algorithm for polygons.
