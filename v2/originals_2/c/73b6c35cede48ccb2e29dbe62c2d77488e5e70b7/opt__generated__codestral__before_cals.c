 This is a C function that writes an image to a blob in the CALS format. The function takes an Image* as input and writes the image data to the blob using various helper functions such as WriteCALSRecord, ParseGeometry, and ImageToBlob. It also uses the Magick++ library for handling images and exceptions.

   Here's a brief explanation of what the code does:

   1. Writes several metadata records to the CALS file header using WriteCALSRecord function.
   2. Determines the orientation of the image and writes it to the header using FormatLocaleString and WriteCALSRecord functions.
   3. Determines the density of the image and writes it to the header using ParseGeometry, floor, FormatLocaleString, and WriteCALSRecord functions.
   4. Writes several more metadata records to the CALS file header using WriteCALSRecord function.
   5. Creates a new Image* object with the GROUP4 format using CloneImage and CopyMagickString functions.
   6. Converts the new image to a blob using ImageToBlob function.
   7. Writes the blob data to the output file using WriteBlob function.
   8. Frees up memory used by the blob and closes the output file using RelinquishMagickMemory, DestroyImageInfo, DestroyImage, and CloseBlob functions.
