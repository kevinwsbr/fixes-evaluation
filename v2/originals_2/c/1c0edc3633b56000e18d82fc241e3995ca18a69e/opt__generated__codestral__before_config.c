 This is a C code for handling the Binary Object Store (BOS) descriptor in USB. The function `usb_get_bos_descriptor` is used to retrieve and parse the BOS descriptor set from a specified USB device. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. Allocate memory for the BOS descriptor and check if allocation was successful. If not, return an error code (ENOMEM).
2. Get the BOS descriptor using `usb_get_descriptor` function. Check if retrieval was successful. If not, free the allocated memory for BOS descriptor and return an appropriate error code.
3. Allocate memory for the USB host BOS and check if allocation was successful. If not, go to the error handling section.
4. Allocate memory for the buffer that will hold the entire BOS descriptor set and check if allocation was successful. If not, go to the error handling section.
5. Retrieve the entire BOS descriptor set using `usb_get_descriptor` function. Check if retrieval was successful. If not, go to the error handling section.
6. Parse through the BOS descriptor set and process each capability descriptor based on its type (Wireless USB, Extended Capabilities, SuperSpeed, SuperSpeed Plus, Container ID, or PTM). For each valid descriptor, store a pointer to it in the corresponding field of the USB host BOS structure.
7. If all steps are successful, return 0 to indicate success.
8. In case of any errors during the process, free allocated memory and return an appropriate error code.
