**Purpose:**

The code provides functions for managing the USB Binary Object Store (BOS) descriptor in a USB device. The BOS descriptor is a set of device capabilities that describe additional features and functionalities supported by the device.

**Key Functions:**

* `usb_get_bos_descriptor()`: Retrieves the BOS descriptor set from the USB device.
* `usb_release_bos_descriptor()`: Frees the memory allocated for the BOS descriptor set.

**Steps:**

1. **Get BOS Descriptor:**
    - Allocates memory for a `struct usb_bos_descriptor` structure.
    - Uses `usb_get_descriptor()` to retrieve the BOS descriptor.
    - Verifies the descriptor size and total length.

2. **Get BOS Descriptor Set:**
    - Allocates memory for the entire BOS descriptor set.
    - Uses `usb_get_descriptor()` again to retrieve the entire set.
    - Parses the descriptor set to extract individual capabilities.

3. **Handle Capabilities:**
    - Based on the capability type, stores the corresponding descriptor in the `dev->bos` structure.

4. **Error Handling:**
    - Returns appropriate error codes if memory allocation fails or descriptor retrieval fails.

**Usage:**

To use these functions, simply call `usb_get_bos_descriptor()` to retrieve the BOS descriptor set. You can then access the individual capabilities through the `dev->bos` structure.

**Additional Notes:**

* The `usb_bos_descriptor` structure contains information about the number of capabilities, their types, and the lengths of their descriptors.
* The `usb_dev_cap_header` structure represents a single capability descriptor.
* The `usb_release_bos_descriptor()` function should be called when the BOS descriptor set is no longer needed.

**Conclusion:**

The code provides a comprehensive mechanism for managing the USB BOS descriptor, allowing developers to access and utilize additional device features and functionalities.
