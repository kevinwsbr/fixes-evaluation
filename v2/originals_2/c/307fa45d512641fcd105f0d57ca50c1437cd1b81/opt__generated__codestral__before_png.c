 This code is a part of an image processing library that supports reading and writing images in various formats. The specific section you've shared is responsible for writing images in the MNG (Multiple-image Network Graphics) format using the libpng library, which is a popular open-source library for handling PNG and MNG files.

   Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

   1. The function `WriteMNGImage` takes an `ImageInfo` structure that contains information about the image to be written and the actual `Image` data. It initializes various variables, including pointers to the start and end of the image list, and a counter for the current scene.

   2. The code checks if the user has requested logging of events. If so, it logs that the function has been entered.

   3. The function then enters a loop that iterates over each image in the image list. For each image:
      - It checks if logging is enabled and logs the event of writing a PNG object.
      - It sets various flags to exclude certain ancillary chunks from being written to the file, as they are not supported by MNG.
      - It calls the `WriteOnePNGImage` function to write the image data to the output stream in the PNG format. This function is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the codebase.

   4. If writing any of the images fails, the function cleans up and returns an error status.

   5. After all images have been successfully written, if the user has requested MNG output:
      - The function rewinds the image list to the first image.
      - It writes a `MEND` chunk to mark the end of the MNG stream.

   6. Finally, the function closes the output stream and frees any resources allocated during the writing process. If logging is enabled, it logs that the function has been exited. The function returns a success status if all operations have completed successfully.
