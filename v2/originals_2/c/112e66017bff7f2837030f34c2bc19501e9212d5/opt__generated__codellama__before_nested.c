  This is a set of functions and data structures that are used to support nested virtualization in the Linux kernel. The `nested_vmx_hardware_setup` function sets up the necessary data structures for nested virtualization, including allocating memory for a bitmap that is used to track which VMCS fields have been updated since they were last saved to the host VMCS. The `nested_vmx_hardware_unsetup` function frees this memory when it is no longer needed.

The `vmx_get_nested_state` and `vmx_set_nested_state` functions are used to save and restore the state of a nested virtual machine, respectively. The `vmx_get_nested_state_pages` function returns an array of pages that contain the saved state of the nested virtual machine.

The `vmx_check_nested_events` function is called by KVM to check whether any events have occurred in the guest that require it to take action, such as injecting a VM exit into the guest or updating the host's view of the guest's state. The `vmx_has_nested_events` function returns true if there are any pending events that need to be handled by KVM.

The `nested_vmx_triple_fault` function is called when a triple fault occurs in the guest, which can happen for various reasons such as a page fault or an interrupt being generated while the guest is in a virtual-8086 mode. The `nested_vmx_is_exception_vmexit` function is used to determine whether a given exit reason indicates that the guest has taken an exception and needs to be injected with a new VM entry.

The `vmx_hv_inject_synthetic_vmexit_post_tlb_flush` function is used by KVM to inject a synthetic VM exit into the guest following a TLB flush operation.

The `nested_enable_evmcs` function is called when EVMCS (Extended Virtual Machine Control Structure) support is enabled for a virtual machine, and it returns true if the guest supports EVMCS and false otherwise. The `nested_get_evmcs_version` function is used to get the version of EVMCS that is supported by the guest.
