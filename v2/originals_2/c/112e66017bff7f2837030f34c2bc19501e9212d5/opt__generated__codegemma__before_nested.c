**Purpose:**

The code snippet you provided is responsible for setting up and tearing down the nested virtualization mode (VMMX) on an x86 system. It is part of the Linux kernel's virtual machine management (KVM) framework.

**Key Functions:**

- **nested_vmx_hardware_setup:** Initializes the necessary data structures and handlers for VMMX.
- **nested_vmx_hardware_unsetup:** Frees the allocated resources associated with VMMX.

**Key Variables:**

- **enable_shadow_vmcs:** A flag that determines whether shadow VMCS is enabled.
- **vmx_bitmap:** An array of pointers to pages used for shadow VMCS.

**Key Constants:**

- **VMX_BITMAP_NR:** The number of pages used for shadow VMCS.

**Key Concepts:**

- **VMMX:** A virtualization mode that allows virtual machines to run on physical hardware.
- **Shadow VMCS:** A mechanism that allows virtual machines to access shadow registers and MSRs.
- **MSRs:** Machine-Specific Registers, which are used by hardware to communicate with the operating system.

**Usage:**

The code is part of the KVM framework and is used to implement nested virtualization. When enabled, it allows virtual machines to run within other virtual machines.

**Additional Notes:**

- The code requires the CPU to support the VMX hardware virtualization extension.
- Shadow VMCS is an optional feature that improves performance by allowing virtual machines to access shadow registers and MSRs.
- The `exit_handlers` array contains handlers for different VMMX exit reasons.
- The `vmx_nested_ops` structure defines the operations that can be performed in nested VMMX mode.
