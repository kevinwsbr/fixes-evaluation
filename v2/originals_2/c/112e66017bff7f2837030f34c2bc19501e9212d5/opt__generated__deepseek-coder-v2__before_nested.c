 The provided code snippet is part of a larger kernel module related to nested virtualization in KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine). The module is responsible for setting up and tearing down certain hardware configurations necessary for nested VMX operation. Here's a breakdown of the key components and functions within this snippet:

### Key Components:
1. **VMXON Instruction Setup:**
   - The `nested_vmx_hardware_setup` function initializes the necessary MSRs (Model-Specific Registers) required for enabling nested virtualization using the VMXON instruction. This involves setting up CR0 and CR4 registers with specific bits as per the defined macros (`VMXON_CR0_ALWAYSON` and `VMXON_CR4_ALWAYSON`), reading fixed MSRs related to CR0 and CR4 (from `MSR_IA32_VMX_CR0_FIXED1` and `MSR_IA32_VMX_CR4_FIXED1`), and handling any additional requirements like the UMIP bit.

2. **Shadow VMCS Setup:**
   - If shadow VMCS (Virtual Machine Control Structure) is enabled, the function allocates pages for bitmap management used in nested virtualization. This involves calling `__get_free_page` to allocate memory pages and handling potential failures by invoking `nested_vmx_hardware_unsetup()` and returning an error if allocation fails.

3. **Exit Handlers:**
   - An array of function pointers (`exit_handlers`) is initialized for handling different exit reasons that can occur during nested virtualization, mapping specific KVM exit handlers to corresponding VMX exits.

4. **Nested Operations Structure:**
   - A structure `vmx_nested_ops` is defined for exposing the nested virtualization operations supported by this module, including functions for leaving nested mode, checking events, and handling various nested-specific functionalities.

### Functions:
1. **`nested_vmx_hardware_setup`:**
   - This function sets up the necessary MSRs and memory allocations required for nested VMX operation. It checks if shadow VMCS is supported by the CPU and allocates necessary resources accordingly. It also initializes exit handlers for different VMX exit reasons.

2. **`nested_vmx_hardware_unsetup`:**
   - This function deallocates memory pages used for bitmap management in case of setup failure or when the feature is no longer needed, ensuring no memory leaks occur.

3. **Struct `vmx_nested_ops`:**
   - A structure defining nested virtualization operations, providing a standardized interface for KVM to interact with the VMX implementation details.

### Usage Context:
This code snippet is likely part of a Linux kernel module designed to extend the capabilities of KVM to support nested virtual machines, leveraging Intel's VT-x technology for enhanced performance and functionality. The setup and teardown functions ensure that all necessary hardware configurations are correctly applied before and after using these features, respectively, which is crucial for maintaining system stability and performance during virtualization operations.

### Error Handling:
The module includes error handling mechanisms like returning `-ENOMEM` in case of memory allocation failure in the setup function, ensuring graceful degradation or termination in such scenarios.
