**Purpose**

The provided code snippet registers and unregisters the XCF (GIMP Image) image format with the Magick library. This format is used to represent images created in the GIMP image editor.

**Code Breakdown**

**RegisterXCFImage()**
- Creates a new `MagickInfo` entry for the XCF format.
- Sets the decoder handler to `ReadXCFImage`, which handles reading XCF images.
- Sets the magick handler to `IsXCF`, which checks if an image is in the XCF format.
- Sets the `CoderSeekableStreamFlag` to indicate that XCF images support seeking within the file.
- Registers the `MagickInfo` entry.

**UnregisterXCFImage()**
- Unregisters the XCF format registration.

**Usage**

The `RegisterXCFImage()` function should be called during initialization to register the XCF format. The `UnregisterXCFImage()` function should be called when the application is shutting down to release resources.

**Key Features**

- Supports reading and writing XCF images.
- Supports saving multiple frames to the same file.
- Supports native in-memory I/O.

**Benefits**

- Enables integration with GIMP files.
- Provides seamless image handling capabilities.
- Supports advanced image features and functionalities.

**Limitations**

- Requires the Magick library to be installed.
- May have compatibility issues with older versions of GIMP.

**Additional Notes**

- The code snippet includes comments and annotations for clarity.
- The `MagickImageCoderSignature` constant is used to identify the XCF format.
- The `XCFLayerInfo` structure is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code.
