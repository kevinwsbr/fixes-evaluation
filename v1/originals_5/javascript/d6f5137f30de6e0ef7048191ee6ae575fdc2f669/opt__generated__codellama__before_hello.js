This code adds a feature to the `hello` library that allows it to handle responses from OAuth authorization flows in the current web page or in an iframe embedded in the web page. This is useful when implementing SSO (single sign-on) authentication flows, where the user is redirected to another website and then sent back to the original one with a token.

The `responseHandler` function takes two arguments:

1. `window`: The current window object in which to look for an access token. This is typically the global `window` object.
2. `opener` or `parent`: A reference to the opener window (if any) or the parent window, respectively. These are used to get the URL of the current web page and look for an access token in its hash (fragment) part.

The function works as follows:

1. It first retrieves the current `window` object's location (using `location`). If it has a hash (`#`) character followed by a non-empty string, it extracts that string and decodes it using `decodeURIComponent`. This is done to obtain the access token (which is typically in a URL-encoded format).
2. It then looks for an opener or parent window object and gets its location using `location`. If it has a hash character followed by a non-empty string, it extracts that string and decodes it using `decodeURIComponent`. This is done to obtain the access token (which is typically in a URL-encoded format).
3. If an access token was found either in the current window's location or its opener or parent window's locations, it calls the `login` function of the `hello` library with that token and the name of the service that granted it (`responseHandler`, for example). This allows the user to be logged into the corresponding OAuth service.
4. If no access token was found in either the current window's location or its opener or parent window's locations, the function returns `undefined`.

To use this feature, you would typically call the `responseHandler` function when your web page is loaded, and it will handle any response from OAuth authorization flows and log the user into the appropriate service if necessary.
