 This is a PHP class named `class_link` that provides various methods for generating URLs or links based on specific parameters. Here's a breakdown of the methods:

1. `getLinkPortalHref($strPageI, $strPageE, $strAction = "", $arrParams = array(), $strAnchor = "")`: This method generates an absolute portal link with optional parameters and anchor. It checks if a system ID is provided or not and constructs the URL accordingly.

2. `getLinkPortal($strPageI, $strPageE, $strAction = "", $arrParams = array(), $strAnchor = "")`: This method returns an HTML link with the absolute portal link generated by `getLinkPortalHref()`.

3. `parseParamsString($strParams, &$strSystemid = "")`: An internal helper method that transforms a passed parameters string into an array and extracts the system ID from the string if present. It then updates the passed reference with the extracted system ID.

4. `getIntNumberOfPortalLanguages()` and `getStrPortalLanguage()`: Helper methods to determine the number of portal languages only once and fetch the portal language, respectively. These values are cached for performance optimization.

5. `getLinkPortalPopup($strPageI, $strPageE, $strAction = "", $strParams = "", $strSystemid = "", $strTitle = "", $intWidth = "500", $intHeight = "500")`: This method generates a link that opens in a popup within the portal-area. It uses `getLinkPortalHref()` to construct the URL and then wraps it inside an HTML anchor tag with the specified width, height, and title attributes.

The class also has a private static variable `$intNrOfPortalLanguages` to cache the number of portal languages and `$strPortalLanguage` to cache the current portal language for performance optimization.
