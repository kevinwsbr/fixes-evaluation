 The provided code snippet is part of a larger PHP script that likely resides within an application for managing languages, possibly in a Learning Management System (LMS). It dynamically generates and displays a table of language information, allowing users to edit or make languages available/unavailable based on their current status. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. **HTML Generation**: The script constructs HTML elements like `<a>` tags and `<img>` tags for icons and links used in the interface. These include actions such as adding terms to sub-languages, editing language properties, making languages visible or invisible, and deleting sub-languages.

2. **Conditional Rendering**: Depending on whether a language is available (`$row['available'] == 1`) or not, it will display different icons and links for visibility toggling (visible/invisible) and editing.

3. **JavaScript Integration**: The script includes JavaScript functionality by adding `<a>` tags with `class="make_visible_and_invisible"` which likely trigger a JavaScript function to change the language's availability status when clicked. This suggests that dynamic interactions are managed client-side through JavaScript, possibly using jQuery or another library.

4. **Table Configuration**: The script uses an array (`$language_data`) and `SortableTableFromArrayConfig` class to configure a table where each row contains data about a language (e.g., original name, English name, LMS folder). This table is then rendered with headers corresponding to different aspects of the languages (Original Name, English Name, etc.).

5. **Form Actions**: The script also defines form actions for making a language available or unavailable, which are used as options in the table's action menu.

6. **Rendering the Table**: Finally, it initializes and displays the configured table using `$table->display()`.

7. **Final Output**: After generating all HTML elements for the table and actions, the script outputs everything to the client side where a user interface is presented. This could be an admin panel in an LMS or another management tool used to configure language settings.

This code snippet appears to be part of a larger application that manages multilingual content within a system, allowing users to maintain and manipulate languages dynamically based on their availability and other properties defined in the script.
