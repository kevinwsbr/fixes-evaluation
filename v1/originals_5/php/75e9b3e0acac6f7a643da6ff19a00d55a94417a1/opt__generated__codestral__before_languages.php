 This code is a part of an application that manages languages and sub-languages. It generates a table to display the available languages, their properties, and provides actions such as editing, making available or unavailable, and adding terms for sub-languages. Here's a breakdown:

1. The script retrieves all the necessary data about each language (original name, English name, LMS folder, availability) and stores it in an array ($language_data).
2. For each row of data, it checks if the language is currently set as the platform language. If it is, a specific icon and edit link are added to the row's actions column. Otherwise, additional links for making the language available or unavailable are included.
3. It also checks if sub-languages are enabled. If they are, additional columns and actions are displayed for each sub-language associated with the main language. These include adding words for a sub-language, enabling/disabling its use, and deleting it.
4. A SortableTableFromArrayConfig object is created to display the data in a table format. The headers of the table are set accordingly.
5. The table is then displayed on the page.
