This code defines several functions and macros for working with pixel formats and encrypting data. It includes several C modules, such as `rre.c`, `corre.c`, `hextile.c`, `ultra.c`, `zlib.c`, `tight.c`, `trle.c`, and `zrle.c`.

Here are the key definitions:

* `rfbPixelFormat`: A structure that defines a pixel format, including the number of bits per pixel, whether it is true color or not, and the maximum values for each of red, green, blue, and shift values for each of them.
* `PrintPixelFormat`: A function that prints information about a pixel format.
* `rfbEncryptBytes`, `rfbEncryptBytes2`, `rfbDes`, `rfbDesKey`, and `rfbUseKey`: These are definitions for functions that perform encryption and decryption operations, using the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm.
* `vncauth_get_key`: A function that generates a key for use with DES-based encryption.
* `D3DEncryptBytes`, `D3DEncryptBytes2`, `D3DDecryptBytes`, and `D3DDecryptBytes2`: These are definitions for functions that perform encryption and decryption operations, using the Differential Cryptanalysis (D3D) algorithm.
* `vncauth_get_key`: A function that generates a key for use with D3D-based encryption.
