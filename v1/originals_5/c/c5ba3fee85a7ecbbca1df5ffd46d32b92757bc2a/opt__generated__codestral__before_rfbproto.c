 These lines of code are defining a macro to assign two bytes of data to a pixel variable, which is then stored as a 16-bit or 32-bit value depending on the architecture and platform. The first line assigns the second byte of the pixel variable to the value pointed to by `ptr`, and increments the pointer. The second line assigns the third byte of the pixel variable to the next value pointed to by `ptr`, and again increments the pointer.

   The rest of the code includes various files that contain implementations of different compression algorithms used in the VNC (Virtual Network Computing) protocol, such as RRE (Raw Rectangle Encoding), CoRRE (Copy Rectangle Encoding), Hextile encoding, Ultra encoding, Zlib encoding, Tight encoding, TRLE encoding, and Zrle encoding. The `#define` statements at the beginning of each group of included files set various preprocessor macros that control the behavior of the code in those files, such as specifying the number of bits per pixel (BPP) or the actual number of bits per pixel for certain compression algorithms.

   The remaining code includes implementations of various cryptographic functions used in the VNC protocol, such as encryption and decryption using the DES algorithm. The `#define` statements at the beginning of this section avoid name clashes with other libraries that may use the same function names.
