**Module Overview**

The AX.25 protocol is a link-layer protocol used in amateur radio communications. This module provides the necessary functionalities for implementing the AX.25 protocol in the Linux kernel.

**Key Features**

- Supports the AX.25 protocol and its associated data structures.
- Provides functions for initializing, releasing, and configuring AX.25 sockets.
- Implements the AX.25 protocol operations, including routing, call handling, and data transmission.
- Offers a set of debug and monitoring facilities through proc files.

**Module Functions**

- `ax25_init()`: Initializes the AX.25 module and registers necessary components.
- `ax25_exit()`: Cleans up resources and unregisters components.
- `ax25_create()`: Creates a new AX.25 socket.
- `ax25_release()`: Releases an AX.25 socket.
- `ax25_bind()`: Binds an AX.25 socket to a local address.
- `ax25_connect()`: Establishes a connection between two AX.25 sockets.
- `ax25_accept()`: Accepts a connection from an incoming AX.25 socket.
- `ax25_getname()`: Retrieves the local or remote address of an AX.25 socket.
- `ax25_ioctl()`: Performs socket-level control operations on an AX.25 socket.
- `ax25_setsockopt()`: Sets socket options on an AX.25 socket.
- `ax25_getsockopt()`: Gets socket options from an AX.25 socket.
- `ax25_sendmsg()`: Sends data on an AX.25 socket.
- `ax25_recvmsg()`: Receives data from an AX.25 socket.

**Proc Files**

- `/proc/net/ax25_route`: Provides information about AX.25 routing tables.
- `/proc/net/ax25`: General AX.25 module information.
- `/proc/net/ax25_calls`: Lists active AX.25 calls.

**Module Usage**

To use the AX.25 module, applications can create AX.25 sockets and use the provided functions to establish connections, send and receive data, and perform other operations.

**Module Installation**

To install the AX.25 module, copy the module files to the kernel source directory and run the `make modules_install` command.

**Module Dependencies**

The AX.25 module depends on the following kernel modules:
- `net`
- `sock`
- `datagram`

**Additional Notes**

- The module supports the AX.25 KISS protocol.
- The module is licensed under the GPL license.
- The module is part of the Linux kernel distribution.
