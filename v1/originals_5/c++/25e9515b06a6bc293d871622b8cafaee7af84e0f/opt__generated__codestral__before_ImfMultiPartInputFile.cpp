 The provided code is a part of the OpenEXR library, specifically from the MultiPartInputFile class implementation in C++. This class is used to handle multi-part input files, which are essentially multiple EXR (OpenEXR) files that collectively form a single image or data set.

Here's a breakdown of some important parts of the code:

1. **Data structure**: The `MultiPartInputFile` class contains an inner `Data` structure that holds details about each part of the multi-part file, such as headers, chunk offset tables, and other metadata.

2. **Chunk offset table handling**: The code includes a method to read chunk offset tables from the input files. If these tables are incomplete or broken (contain invalid values), the `chunkOffsetReconstruction` function is called to attempt to reconstruct them.

3. **Input part data access**: The class provides methods to retrieve specific parts of the multi-part file, and also to check if a given part is complete.

4. **File versioning**: There's a method to get the version of the multi-part input file format being used.
