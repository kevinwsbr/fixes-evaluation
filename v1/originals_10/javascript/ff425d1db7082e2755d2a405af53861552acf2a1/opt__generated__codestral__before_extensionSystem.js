 This code seems to be a part of a larger system that manages extensions in some application or framework. It starts by defining functions for loading, enabling, disabling and reloading extensions.

   The `loadExtension` function first checks if the extension is valid (i.e., it has an 'imports' property with an 'extension' module). If it is, it attempts to initialize the extension by calling its 'init' method. If this fails, it logs the error and returns false. Otherwise, it sets the extension state object, changes the extension state to DISABLED, emits a signal indicating that the extension has been loaded, and returns true.

   The `getEnabledExtensions` function retrieves a list of enabled extensions either from the `Main.sessionMode.enabledExtensions` property or from the `ENABLED_EXTENSIONS_KEY` setting in global settings, depending on whether it's an array or not. If the `DISABLE_USER_EXTENSIONS_KEY` setting is true, it returns only the system-level enabled extensions.

   The `onEnabledExtensionsChanged` function is called whenever the list of enabled extensions changes. It compares the new list with the old one and enables/disables extensions as necessary.

   The `_loadExtensions` function sets up the extension scanning process, loads all existing extensions, and sets up listeners for changes in the list of enabled extensions or in the version validation setting.

   The `enableAllExtensions` and `disableAllExtensions` functions enable/disable all extensions, respectively. They also handle the case where the extensions have not been initialized yet.

   Finally, the `init` function sets up a listener for session updates and calls `_sessionUpdated` to ensure that the initial state of extensions is correct.
