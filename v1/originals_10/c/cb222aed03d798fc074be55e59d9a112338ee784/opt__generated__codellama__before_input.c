  This is a set of C functions for handling input devices in the Linux kernel. It includes functions for registering and unregistering input devices, as well as functions for working with input handles.

The code uses the "struct input_dev" type to represent input devices. Each struct input_dev instance contains information about a particular input device, such as its name, physical location, and capabilities.

The code also uses the "struct input_handle" type to represent input handles. An input handle is a connection between an input device and an input event consumer, such as a keyboard driver or a mouse driver. The struct input_handle instance contains information about the input handle, such as its name and the input device it is connected to.

The functions in this module are used by input drivers to register and unregister themselves with the kernel. They also provide functions for working with input handles.

The input_register_device function registers an input device with the kernel. It takes a struct input_dev instance as its argument, which contains information about the input device being registered. The function returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure.

The input_unregister_device function unregisters an input device from the kernel. It takes a struct input_dev instance as its argument, which contains information about the input device being unregistered. The function does not return any value.

The input_register_handle function registers an input handle with the kernel. It takes two arguments: a struct input_dev instance representing the input device to be connected to, and a struct input_handle instance representing the input handle being registered. The function returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure.

The input_unregister_handle function unregisters an input handle from the kernel. It takes a struct input_handle instance as its argument, which contains information about the input handle being unregistered. The function does not return any value.

The input_get_new_minor function allocates a new minor number for an input device. It takes three arguments: a base for the legacy range of minor numbers to search (either 0 or negative), a size of the legacy range, and a flag indicating whether dynamic minor numbers should be allowed if there are no free IDs in the legacy range. The function returns the allocated minor number on success or a negative error code on failure.

The input_free_minor function releases an input minor number that was previously allocated with input_get_new_minor. It takes a single argument: the minor number to be released. The function does not return any value.
