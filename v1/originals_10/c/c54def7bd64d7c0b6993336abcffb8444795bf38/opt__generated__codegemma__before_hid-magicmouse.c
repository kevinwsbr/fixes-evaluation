**MagicMouse Driver**

The provided code snippet implements a Linux kernel module for the MagicMouse and MagicTrackpad devices. It handles the input events and provides the necessary functionalities for these devices.

**Key Features:**

- Detects MagicMouse and MagicTrackpad devices
- Parses HID reports
- Configures input reports
- Processes raw events
- Provides input mappings and configuration options

**Functionality:**

- The driver initializes a `magicmouse_sc` structure to store device-specific data.
- It parses the HID reports and registers input reports for mouse and touchpad events.
- The driver handles raw events and maps them to corresponding input events.
- It provides input mappings for scroll acceleration and scroll wheel emulation.
- The driver supports both MagicMouse and MagicTrackpad devices.

**Device Identification:**

- The driver uses the `magic_mice` table to identify MagicMouse and MagicTrackpad devices based on their vendor ID and product ID.
- The `driver_data` field in the table specifies any quirks or configuration options for each device.

**Driver Initialization:**

- The driver is initialized as a HID driver with the `magicmouse_driver` structure.
- It registers the `magicmouse_probe` function as the probe function, which is called when a new device is connected.
- The driver also registers the `magicmouse_raw_event` function to handle raw events.

**Module Registration:**

- The driver is registered as a module with the `module_hid_driver()` function.
- It is loaded into the kernel when the module is installed.

**License:**

- The driver is licensed under the GPLv2.

**Usage:**

- To use the MagicMouse driver, simply install the kernel module and connect a MagicMouse or MagicTrackpad device.
- The driver will automatically configure the device and provide the necessary functionalities.

**Additional Notes:**

- The driver supports both MagicMouse and MagicTrackpad devices.
- The driver provides support for scrolling, clicking, and other mouse functions.
- The driver supports some device quirks, such as setting the report ID.
- The driver handles raw events and maps them to corresponding input events.
