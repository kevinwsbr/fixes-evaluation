 This is a function for printing JSON output of the states in SWTPM (Software TPM). The function checks if each state ("permall", "volatilestate", and "savestate") exists, retrieves its size, and adds it to a string that contains the JSON representation. If no errors occur during this process, the function prints out the entire JSON object.

   Here are some key parts of the code:

   1. `SWTPM_NVRAM_Init()` is called at the beginning of the function to initialize any necessary resources for working with SWTPM's NVRAM (Non-Volatile Random Access Memory).

   2. An array `states[]` contains the names of the states that should be checked and included in the JSON output.

   3. A loop iterates over each state, calling `g_nvram_backend_ops->check_state()` to determine if the state exists and retrieve its size. If an error occurs other than `TPM_RETRY`, the function exits with an error code.

   4. For each state that is found, a JSON object containing the name of the state and its size is added to the string `state_str`. The `snprintf()` function ensures that the output does not exceed the maximum size of the buffer.

   5. If no errors occur during the loop, the function prints out the entire JSON object using `printf()`, including a type field set to "swtpm" and a states field containing an array of objects representing each state found.
