 This is a Linux kernel module that implements parallel crypto wrappers for encryption and decryption using the PADATA (Parallel Data Transformation) framework. The module defines two instances of the `padata_pcrypt` struct, one for encryption (`pencrypt`) and one for decryption (`pdecrypt`).

   The main functionalities of the module include:

   1. Initializing a kernel set for PCrypt and creating workqueues for each instance.
   2. Allocating possible PADATA instances and initializing CPU masks.
   3. Registering CPUMask notifiers to handle changes in the online CPU mask.
   4. Creating sysfs entries for each instance.
   5. Starting the PADATA instances.
   6. Registering a crypto template with the kernel.
   7. Cleaning up resources and unregistering from the kernel when the module is removed.

   The `pcrypt_init` function initializes the PCrypt module, and the `pcrypt_exit` function cleans up resources when the module is unloaded. Error handling is also included to ensure proper cleanup in case of failures during initialization.
