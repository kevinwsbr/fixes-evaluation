 Here is an explanation of the given C++ code:

The code provided registers kernels for a TensorFlow operation named "QuantizeAndDequantize". Kernels are functions that perform operations on data, and in TensorFlow, they are registered for specific devices (CPU, GPU), types (float, double), and configurations. This code adds support for different versions of the operation ("V2", "V3", "V4") with gradient computation for version 4 as well.

The code first defines a macro named `REGISTER_CPU_KERNEL` that registers kernels for CPU devices for a given type (T). The macro is then called with float and double types to register the kernels for these data types on the CPU. This macro expands into multiple `REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER` calls, each one registering a kernel for a specific version of the operation ("QuantizeAndDequantizeV2", "QuantizeAndDequantizeV3", "QuantizeAndDequantizeV4", and "QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad").

Next, under the condition that either CUDA (NVIDIA GPU) or ROCm (AMD GPU) support is enabled in TensorFlow, another macro named `REGISTER_GPU_KERNEL` is defined. This macro works similarly to `REGISTER_CPU_KERNEL`, but it registers kernels for GPU devices instead. The `HostMemory` attribute is used for parameters that need to be copied from the host (CPU) memory to device (GPU) memory before kernel execution.

Finally, the `REGISTER_GPU_KERNEL` macro is called with float and double types to register these kernels on the GPU as well. The last line of the code registers a kernel for the original "QuantizeAndDequantize" operation without versioning.
