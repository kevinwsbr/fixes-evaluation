 This code registers kernel builders for the QuantizeAndDequantizeV2, QuantizeAndDequantizeV3, and QuantizeAndDequantize kernels on the CPU and GPU devices. It uses the TF_CALL_float macro to register kernels for float types.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. `REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER` is a macro that allows you to register kernel builders for various devices and data types.
2. `.Device(DEVICE_CPU)` specifies that the kernel should be registered for CPU devices.
3. `.HostMemory("input_min")` and `.HostMemory("input_max")` specify that the `input_min` and `input_max` tensors should be allocated on host memory (i.e., in main memory rather than on device memory). This is necessary because these tensors are typically small and do not need to be transferred between devices frequently.
4. `.TypeConstraint<T>("T")` specifies that the kernel should be registered for all types `T`.
5. `QuantizeAndDequantizeV2Op` is a template class that takes two template parameters: `Device` and `T`. It defines the operations to perform for the QuantizeAndDequantizeV2 kernel.
6. `REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER(Name("QuantizeAndDequantizeV3") ...)` registers a kernel builder for the QuantizeAndDequantizeV3 kernel on CPU and GPU devices, with host-memory allocation for `input_min` and `input_max`. It also specifies that the kernel should be registered for all types `T`.
7. Similarly, `REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER(Name("QuantizeAndDequantizeV4") ...)` registers a kernel builder for the QuantizeAndDequantizeV4 kernel on CPU and GPU devices, with host-memory allocation for `input_min` and `input_max`. It also specifies that the kernel should be registered for all types `T`.
8. `REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER(Name("QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad") ...)` registers a kernel builder for the QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad kernel on CPU and GPU devices, with host-memory allocation for `input_min`, `input_max`, and `num_bits`. It also specifies that the kernel should be registered for all types `T`.
9. `REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER(Name("QuantizeAndDequantize") ...)` registers a kernel builder for the QuantizeAndDequantize kernel on CPU and GPU devices, with host-memory allocation for `input_min`, `input_max`, and `num_bits`. It also specifies that the kernel should be registered for all types `T`.
10. `REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER(Name("QuantizeAndDequantizeV2") ...)` registers a kernel builder for the QuantizeAndDequantizeV2 kernel on CPU and GPU devices, with host-memory allocation for `input_min` and `input_max`. It also specifies that the kernel should be registered for all types `T`.
11. Similarly, `REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER(Name("QuantizeAndDequantizeV3") ...)` registers a kernel builder for the QuantizeAndDequantizeV3 kernel on CPU and GPU devices, with host-memory allocation for `input_min` and `input_max`. It also specifies that the kernel should be registered for all types `T`.
12. `REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER(Name("QuantizeAndDequantizeV4") ...)` registers a kernel builder for the QuantizeAndDequantizeV4 kernel on CPU and GPU devices, with host-memory allocation for `input_min` and `input_max`. It also specifies that the kernel should be registered for all types `T`.
13. `REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER(Name("QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad") ...)` registers a kernel builder for the QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad kernel on CPU and GPU devices, with host-memory allocation for `input_min`, `input_max`, and `num_bits`. It also specifies that the kernel should be registered for all types `T`.
14. Finally, `REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER(Name("QuantizeAndDequantize") ...)` registers a kernel builder for the QuantizeAndDequantize kernel on CPU and GPU devices, with host-memory allocation for `input_min`, `input_max`, and `num_bits`. It also specifies that the kernel should be registered for all types `T`.
