 This Ruby code defines a set of methods in a Rails controller that handle querying and displaying issues within a project management application. The methods are designed to manage query parameters stored in the session, retrieve them when needed, and present them in a user interface such as a sidebar or hidden form fields. Here's a breakdown of what each method does:

1. **`store_query_in_session(query)`**: This method saves the given `query` object to the session under a key derived from the class name of the query, using underscore notation for the key. It also handles saving additional data like filters, columns, and sort criteria.

2. **`retrieve_query_from_session(klass=IssueQuery)`**: This method retrieves a saved query from the session. If the query is found by its ID in the session, it loads that query; otherwise, it initializes a new one with parameters from the session. It also sets the project for the query based on where it was retrieved from.

3. **`query_as_hidden_field_tags(query)`**: This method generates HTML hidden field tags representing the current state of the `query`, including filters, columns, and sort criteria. These are typically used in forms to preserve the query settings when they are submitted.

4. **`query_hidden_sort_tag(query)`**: Similar to the previous method but specifically for generating a hidden input tag containing the sort criteria of the query.

5. **`sidebar_queries(klass, project)`**: This method retrieves all queries visible and relevant to the given `project`, sorted by their order attribute. It is used to fetch potential queries that can be displayed in the sidebar.

6. **`query_links(title, queries)`**: Generates HTML for displaying a list of queries with links. The title and array of `queries` are passed as parameters. This method constructs URLs based on whether it's being called from an issue controller or not to handle different routing scenarios.

7. **`render_sidebar_queries(klass, project)`**: Renders the query links for both private and public queries by calling `query_links` with subsets of the full list of queries based on their privacy status.

These methods collectively provide a robust way to manage and display user-specific queries within an application that handles issues or similar data types, ensuring they can be restored later even after navigating away from the current page or session.
