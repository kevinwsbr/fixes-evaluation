 The provided PHP code defines several functions that are related to directory size calculation and caching. Here's a breakdown of each function along with their purposes:

1. **recurse_dirsize($directory, $exclude = [], $max_execution_time = 0, &$directory_cache = [])**:
   - This function recursively calculates the size of all files in a directory and its subdirectories.
   - It iterates through each file and subdirectory within `$directory`, adding their sizes to the total `$size`.
   - If a subdirectory is encountered, it calls itself recursively to calculate the size of that subdirectory.
   - The function supports limiting execution time (`$max_execution_time`) using `microtime(true)` to prevent long-running operations from blocking other processes.
   - It uses an array `$directory_cache` for caching directory sizes, which can be reused in subsequent calls to avoid redundant calculations.
   - If the maximum execution time is exceeded, it sets `$size` to `null` and breaks out of the loop.
   - After calculating the size, it caches the result if `$save_cache` is true using `set_transient`.

2. **invalidate_dirsize_cache($path)**:
   - This function invalidates entries within the `dirsize_cache` transient by removing the current directory and all parent directories from the cache.
   - It retrieves the cached data, finds the normalized path of `$path`, and removes it along with all its parent paths until it reaches the root.
   - Finally, it updates the transient with the modified cache.

3. **normalize_dirsize_cache_path($path)**:
   - This function normalizes the directory size cache path by replacing `ABSPATH` with an empty string and removing trailing slashes.
   - It ensures that all paths within the cache are consistent, simplifying management and retrieval.

4. **is_wp_version_compatible($required)**:
   - This function checks if the current WordPress version is compatible with a minimum required version (`$required`).
   - If `$required` is empty or the current version is greater than or equal to the required version, it returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

5. **is_php_version_compatible($required)**:
   - This function checks if the current PHP version is compatible with a minimum required version (`$required`).
   - If `$required` is empty or the current version is greater than or equal to the required version, it returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

6. **wp_fuzzy_number_match($expected, $actual, $precision = 1)**:
   - This function checks if two numbers are nearly the same within a specified precision (`$precision`).
   - It uses absolute difference to determine if the actual number is within the allowed variation of the expected number.

These functions collectively provide a robust way to manage and calculate directory sizes, including caching results for efficiency and handling different WordPress and PHP versions compatibility checks.
