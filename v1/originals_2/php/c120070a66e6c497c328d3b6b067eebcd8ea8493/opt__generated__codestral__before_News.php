 This code is a part of a larger application and it appears to be related to handling news entries in a database. The class provides methods to retrieve, add, update, and delete news entries from the database. Here's an explanation of each method:

1. `getNews()`: Fetches news data from the database based on specific criteria such as date range, status, and language. It returns an array containing the fetched data in a structured format.

2. `addNewsEntry(array $data)`: Adds a new news entry to the database by executing an SQL INSERT statement. The method takes an array of data as input and inserts it into the corresponding columns in the `faqnews` table.

3. `updateNewsEntry(int $id, array $data)`: Updates an existing news entry in the database by executing an SQL UPDATE statement. The method takes two parameters - the ID of the news entry to be updated and an array of data containing the new values for the columns.

4. `deleteNews(int $id)`: Deletes a news entry from the database based on its ID and language using an SQL DELETE statement. It returns true if the deletion is successful, false otherwise.
