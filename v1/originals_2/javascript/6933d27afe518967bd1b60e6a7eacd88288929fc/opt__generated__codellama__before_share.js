This code listens for changes to the input field with the ID "expirationDate" and sends an AJAX request to the server when the user updates the field. The request is sent using the `PUT` method and includes the current value of the input field as well as some metadata about the share.

If the server returns an error, the code will update the title attribute of the input field with the error message provided by the server, and display a tooltip with that message using the jQueryUI library's `tooltip()` method. The tooltip is displayed in the top position (`placement: 'top'`).

The code also updates the CSS class of the input field to indicate an error has occurred.

Note that this code is only executed when the user selects a new value for the expiration date, and not when the page loads or when the user navigates away from the page. This means that if the user reloads the page or navigates away from it before making any changes to the expiration date, the code will not be executed.
