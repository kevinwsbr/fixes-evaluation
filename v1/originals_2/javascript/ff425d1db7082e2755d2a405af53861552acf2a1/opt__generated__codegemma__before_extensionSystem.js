**Module Overview:**

The code snippet you provided is a JavaScript module that manages the loading, enabling, and disabling of extensions in a system.

**Key Functions:**

* **loadExtension:** Loads an extension by parsing its code and initializing it.
* **enableExtension:** Enables an extension by setting its state to "ENABLED" and emitting an event.
* **disableExtension:** Disables an extension by setting its state to "DISABLED" and emitting an event.
* **getEnabledExtensions:** Retrieves a list of enabled extensions from the session mode settings or user preferences.
* **onEnabledExtensionsChanged:** Handles changes in the list of enabled extensions by enabling or disabling them accordingly.
* **_onVersionValidationChanged:** Reloads all extensions when the version validation setting changes.
* **_loadExtensions:** Loads all extensions specified in the enabled extensions setting.
* **enableAllExtensions:** Enables all extensions if initialization has been completed and session mode allows extensions.
* **disableAllExtensions:** Disables all extensions.
* **_sessionUpdated:** Updates the enabled extensions based on the session mode settings.

**Initialization:**

The module initializes by connecting to settings change events and loading extensions based on the enabled extensions setting.

**Usage:**

* To enable all extensions, call `enableAllExtensions()`.
* To disable all extensions, call `disableAllExtensions()`.

**Additional Notes:**

* The module uses an `ExtensionUtils` object to manage extensions.
* The `EXTENSION_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK_KEY` setting controls whether version validation is performed when extensions are loaded.
* The `ENABLED_EXTENSIONS_KEY` setting specifies the list of enabled extensions.
* The `DISABLE_USER_EXTENSIONS_KEY` setting determines whether user-installed extensions are disabled.

**Overall, this module provides a comprehensive mechanism for managing extensions in a system.**
