The `ByteArray` class in SFNTly is a wrapper around an array of bytes. It provides methods for getting and setting the contents of the byte array, as well as copying data from other sources into the array or to other destinations. The constructor takes two parameters: the length of the array when it is filled and the total storage capacity of the array (including any unused space).

The `CopyTo` method copies a subset of the bytes in the byte array to an output stream, starting at a specified offset. It returns the number of bytes actually copied. The `CopyFrom` method copies data from an input stream into the byte array, growing the array as needed to accommodate the incoming data.

The `CopyTo` and `CopyFrom` methods are used for serializing and deserializing SFNTly objects, respectively. For example, when a font object is serialized, its glyph data is copied to an output stream using the `CopyTo` method. When a font object is deserialized, its glyph data is copied from an input stream using the `CopyFrom` method.

The `ByteArray` class also provides methods for getting and setting the length of the filled portion of the byte array, as well as growing or shrinking the array as needed to accommodate changes in the number of bytes stored. These methods are used by other SFNTly classes that need to interact with the byte array, such as `FontFile` and `FontSerializer`.

Overall, the `ByteArray` class provides a simple but powerful tool for manipulating arrays of bytes. Its ability to grow or shrink as needed makes it useful for tasks such as serializing and deserializing SFNTly objects, while its methods for getting and setting the length of the filled portion of the array make it easy to interact with other SFNTly classes that need to work with byte arrays.
