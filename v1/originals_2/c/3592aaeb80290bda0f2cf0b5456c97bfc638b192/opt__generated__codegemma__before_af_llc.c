**Purpose:**

The provided code is a Linux kernel module that implements the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) over LLC (Logical Link Control) network protocol. It handles LLC operations such as packet reception, transmission, and configuration.

**Key Features:**

- Implements the LLC protocol family and protocol.
- Provides functions for creating, binding, connecting, accepting, and shutting down LLC sockets.
- Supports LLC operations like setsockopt, getsockopt, and ioctl.
- Registers proc and sysctl entries for LLC configuration and monitoring.
- Implements LLC message handlers for destination SAP and connection-oriented traffic.

**Functionalities:**

- `llc_ui_create`: Creates an LLC socket.
- `llc_ui_release`: Releases an LLC socket.
- `llc_ui_bind`: Binds an LLC socket to a local address.
- `llc_ui_connect`: Establishes a connection on an LLC socket.
- `llc_ui_accept`: Accepts incoming connections on an LLC socket.
- `llc_ui_getname`: Retrieves the local or remote address of an LLC socket.
- `llc_ui_ioctl`: Performs LLC-specific operations based on the specified command.
- `llc_ui_setsockopt`: Sets an option on an LLC socket.
- `llc_ui_getsockopt`: Gets an option from an LLC socket.
- `llc_ui_sendmsg`: Sends data on an LLC socket.
- `llc_ui_recvmsg`: Receives data from an LLC socket.

**Initialization and Exit:**

- `llc2_init`: Initializes the LLC protocol module, registers the necessary protocol operations, and sets up LLC message handlers.
- `llc2_exit`: Unregisters the protocol operations, releases resources, and exits the module.

**Error Handling:**

- The module logs error messages if any errors occur during initialization, configuration, or operation.
