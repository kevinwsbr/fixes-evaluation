**Purpose:**

The provided code snippet defines two methods for registering and unregistering support for the WordPerfect Graphics (WPG) image format in a graphics processing library.

**RegisterWPGImage() Method:**

* Creates a new entry in the list of supported image formats.
* Sets the image format tag to "WPG".
* Provides a method to read and write WPG images (ReadWPGImage handler).
* Indicates that the format supports seeking within the image data.
* Sets a brief description of the WPG image format.

**UnregisterWPGImage() Method:**

* Removes the WPG image format registration from the list of supported formats.

**Usage:**

To use the WPG image support, you would typically:

1. Register the WPG format by calling `RegisterWPGImage()`.
2. Use the `ReadWPGImage()` method to load WPG images.
3. Use the `IsWPG()` method to check if an image is in WPG format.
4. Unregister the WPG format when it is no longer needed using `UnregisterWPGImage()`.

**Benefits:**

* Enables the processing and handling of WPG images.
* Provides a convenient way to register and unregister image formats.

**Additional Notes:**

* The code assumes the existence of certain functions and structures, such as `MagickInfo`, `DecodeImageHandler`, `IsImageFormatHandler`, and `AcquireMagickInfo`.
* The `ReadWPGImage()` method is responsible for reading and decoding WPG image data.
* The `IsWPG()` method is used to determine if an image is in WPG format.
