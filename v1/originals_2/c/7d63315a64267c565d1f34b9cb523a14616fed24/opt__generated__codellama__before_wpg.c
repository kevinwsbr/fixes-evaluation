This code registers the WPG image format with ImageMagick. It uses the `RegisterMagickInfo` function to add attributes for the WPG image format to the list of supported formats. The attributes include the image format tag, a method to read and write the format, whether the format supports saving more than one frame to the same file or blob, whether the format supports native in-memory I/O, and a brief description of the format.

The `IsWPG` function is used by ImageMagick to determine if an image is in WPG format. It uses the `IsImageFormatHandler` function to check if the given image has the "WPG" format.

The `ReadWPGImage` function reads a WPG image file and returns it as a MagickWand object. It uses the `MagickGetImageFromWPGFile` function to read the image from the file, and then converts it into a MagickWand object using the `NewMagickWandFromImage` function.

The `ExtractPostscript` function is not implemented in this example code.
