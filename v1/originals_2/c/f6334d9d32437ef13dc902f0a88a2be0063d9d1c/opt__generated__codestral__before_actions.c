 The function `action_tag_list_xml` is used to generate an XML representation of the metadata in an ExifData object. This function uses the `escape_xml` function to ensure that any special characters in the text are properly escaped to make sure the output is a valid XML document. It then iterates over all IFDs or just a single IFD (depending on the value of `p.ifd`) and calls the `show_xml` function for each one, which in turn iterates over all entries in that IFD and calls the `show_entry_xml` function for each entry to generate the XML representation of that entry. The XML output is written to standard out.
