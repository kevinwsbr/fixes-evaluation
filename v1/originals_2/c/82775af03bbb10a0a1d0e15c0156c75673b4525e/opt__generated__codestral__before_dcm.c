 /* The provided code is a C implementation for reading DICOM image files. DICOM, or Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine, is a standard for handling medical images. This code registers the DICOM format with the MagickWand library and provides functions to read and decode DICOM images.

Here's a brief overview of what the code does:

1. `RegisterDCMImage` function: This function adds attributes for the DCM image format to the list of supported formats in the MagickWand library. The attributes include the image format tag, a method to read and decode the format, whether the format supports seeking, and a brief description of the format.

2. `UnregisterDCMImage` function: This function removes the format registrations made by the DCM module from the list of supported formats in the MagickWand library.

3. `ReadDCMImage` function: This is the main function for reading and decoding DICOM images. It follows these steps:
   - Opens the input stream and reads metadata about the image such as its width, height, number of channels, compression type, etc.
   - Decodes the pixel data based on its transfer syntax (i.e., how the pixels are encoded). Supported transfer syntaxes include explicit little-endian, implicit little-endian, JPEG baseline (sequential), and JPEG lossless (non-hierarchical).
   - Converts the decoded pixel data to a MagickWand image structure.
   - Closes the input stream and returns the resulting image. */
