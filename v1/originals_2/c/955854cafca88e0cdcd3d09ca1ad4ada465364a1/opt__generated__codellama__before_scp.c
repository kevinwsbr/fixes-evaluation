 This is a C code that contains a number of functions for handling errors and printing messages to the console. The code also contains a number of variables that are used to store information about the file transfer, such as the current error count `errs` and whether or not a remote host is being used `iamremote`.

Some important notes on this code:

* The function `run_err` prints an error message to the console. It takes a variable number of arguments, which are formatted into the message using `vsnprintf`.
* The function `vfmprintf` is similar to `fprintf`, but it is designed to be used in situations where you want to print to both stdout and stderr simultaneously. This is useful for debugging purposes.
* The function `note_err` is used to keep track of any errors that occur during the file transfer. If an error occurs, it will be stored in a static variable called `emsg`, which can later be printed using `run_err`. The function returns -1 if an error has been noted, and 0 otherwise.
* The function `verifydir` verifies that a given path is a directory by calling `stat` on it. If the path does not exist or is not a directory, it will print an error message to the console using `run_err`.
* The function `okname` checks whether a given string is a valid user name. It returns 1 if the name is valid, and 0 otherwise. If the name is invalid, it will print an error message to the console using `run_err`.
* The function `allocbuf` allocates memory for a buffer. It takes as arguments the current buffer `bp`, the file descriptor of the file being read/written from/to `fd`, and the desired block size `blksize`. If the current buffer is large enough, it will return the current buffer. Otherwise, it will allocate a new buffer of size `size` (where `size` is the larger of `stb.st_blksize` or `blksize`).
* The function `lostconn` is called when a connection is lost during a file transfer. It prints an error message to the console and exits the program with a non-zero exit code if the argument `signo` is not zero, otherwise it calls `_exit(1)` or `exit(1)`.
