 The provided code appears to be part of a kernel module that implements support for nested virtualization using the VMX (Virtual Machine Extensions) technology in the x86 architecture. Here's a brief explanation of the main components and functions:

1. `nested_vmx_hardware_setup`: This function sets up the necessary resources and exit handlers for nested VMX. It checks if the CPU supports shadow VMCS (Virtual Machine Control Structure) and allocates memory for bitmaps used in shadowing. It also initializes an array of exit handlers that will be called when specific VM exits occur.

2. `nested_vmx_hardware_unsetup`: This function is responsible for cleaning up the resources allocated during `nested_vmx_hardware_setup`. If shadow VMCS was enabled, it frees the memory used by the bitmaps.

3. `nested_vmx_get_msrs`: This function retrieves MSR (Model-Specific Register) values relevant to nested virtualization and stores them in a `struct msrs` object. It handles both fixed and variable MSRs, depending on whether VMX is emulated or not.

4. Nested VMX operations (`vmx_nested_ops`): This structure defines various operations that can be performed by nested virtualization, such as leaving the nested environment, checking for events, handling triple faults, and managing nested state.
