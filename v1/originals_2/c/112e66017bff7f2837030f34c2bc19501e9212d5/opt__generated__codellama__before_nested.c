This code defines the `vmx_nested_ops` structure, which is used to implement nested virtualization in KVM. This structure contains a number of functions that are called by KVM when managing the nested state of a VM.

The `leave_nested` function is used to leave the nested mode and transition back to the host. The `is_exception_vmexit` function is used to check if an exception exit occurred in the guest, which can happen due to a number of reasons such as a page fault or an illegal instruction. The `check_events` function is used to check for any events that need to be handled by the host, such as a TLB flush. The `has_events` function is used to check if there are any events pending in the guest.

The `triple_fault` function is called when a triple fault occurs in the guest, and it will exit the nested mode and transition back to the host. The `get_state` and `set_state` functions are used to retrieve and update the state of the VMCS for the current VM. The `get_nested_state_pages` function is used to get the number of pages required by the nested state of the VM.

The `write_log_dirty` function is called when a page in the guest's TLB needs to be written back to memory. This function will inject a VMLAUNCH exit into the guest if it is not currently in the nested mode.

Finally, the `enable_evmcs`, `get_evmcs_version`, and `hv_inject_synthetic_vmexit_post_tlb_flush` functions are used to enable and disable EVMCS (Enhanced VMCS) support in KVM, which allows for more efficient handling of nested virtualization.

Overall, this code defines a number of functions that are called by KVM when managing the nested state of a VM, as well as some helper functions for dealing with events and exceptions in the guest.
