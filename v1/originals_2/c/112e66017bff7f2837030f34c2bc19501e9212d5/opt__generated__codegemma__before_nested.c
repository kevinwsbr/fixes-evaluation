**Purpose:**

The provided code snippet defines the `nested_vmx_hardware_setup()` and `nested_vmx_hardware_unsetup()` functions for initializing and cleanup routines related to nested virtualization mode (VMMX) in the Linux kernel.

**Key Functions:**

- `nested_vmx_hardware_setup()`:
    - Checks if shadow VMCS (Virtual Machine Control Structure) is supported.
    - Allocates memory for the VMX bitmap.
    - Sets up exit handlers for various VMMX events.
    - Returns 0 on success, -ENOMEM if memory allocation fails.

- `nested_vmx_hardware_unsetup()`:
    - Frees the allocated VMX bitmap memory.

**Initialization:**

- The `nested_vmx_hardware_setup()` function initializes the VMX bitmap and sets up exit handlers for VMMX events.
- It also enables shadow VMCS if supported.

**Cleanup:**

- The `nested_vmx_hardware_unsetup()` function frees the allocated VMX bitmap memory.

**Exit Handlers:**

- The code defines exit handlers for various VMMX events, such as VMclear, VMlaunch, VMPTL, VMread, VMwrite, VMoff, VMON, and VMfunc.
- These handlers are responsible for handling specific VMMX events that occur during guest execution.

**Nested VMX Operations:**

- The `vmx_nested_ops` structure defines the operations related to nested VMMX, including:
    - Entering and leaving nested mode
    - Checking for VMMX events
    - Handling VMMX exceptions
    - Writing PML (Page Map Level) buffer

**Conclusion:**

The code snippet initializes and sets up the necessary components for nested VMMX operation in the Linux kernel. It handles VMMX events, initializes memory, and provides operations for nested VM execution.
