**mtree_atol**

The `mtree_atol()` function converts a string to an integer in various formats:

- Base 8 if the first character is '0' and the second character is not 'x' or 'X'.
- Base 10 if the first character is not '0'.
- Base 16 if the first two characters are '0x' or '0X'.

**mtree_atol10**

The `mtree_atol10()` function converts a string to an integer in base 10. It handles negative numbers by checking for a '-' sign. It iterates through the string, converting each digit to an integer and multiplying it by the appropriate power of 10.

**mtree_atol16**

The `mtree_atol16()` function converts a hexadecimal string to an integer. It iterates through the string, converting each hexadecimal digit to an integer and multiplying it by the appropriate power of 16.

**mtree_atol8**

The `mtree_atol8()` function converts an octal string to an integer. It iterates through the string, converting each octal digit to an integer and multiplying it by the appropriate power of 8.

**readline**

The `readline()` function reads a line from an archive. It checks for line length limitations and handles escaped newlines. It also checks for comment lines starting with '#'.

**Key Points:**

- The `mtree_atol()` function handles different base formats.
- The `readline()` function handles line length limitations, escaped newlines, and comment lines.
- The functions use the `__archive_read_*` functions to read from the archive.
