**rose_encode() Function:**

The `rose_encode()` function is responsible for encoding a ROSET packet into a byte buffer. It takes a `struct rose_sock` as input, which contains the ROSET data. The function performs the following steps:

- Calculates the length of the packet.
- Sets the packet header.
- Encodes the source and destination callsigns.
- Encodes the source and destination addresses.
- Returns the length of the encoded packet.

**rose_disconnect() Function:**

The `rose_disconnect()` function is responsible for handling ROSET disconnections. It takes a `struct sock` as input, along with a reason, cause, and diagnostic. The function performs the following steps:

- Stops the ROSET timer and idle timer.
- Clears the ROSET queues.
- Resets the ROSET state.
- Sets the socket state to `TCP_CLOSE`.
- Sets the socket error code.
- Sets the socket to the `SOCK_DEAD` flag.

**Key Differences:**

- The `rose_encode()` function focuses on encoding the ROSET packet, while the `rose_disconnect()` function handles ROSET disconnections.
- The `rose_encode()` function returns the length of the encoded packet, while the `rose_disconnect()` function does not.

**Purpose:**

The `rose_encode()` function is essential for transmitting ROSET packets. The `rose_disconnect()` function is essential for handling ROSET disconnections.

**Usage:**

The `rose_encode()` function is called when a ROSET packet needs to be sent. The `rose_disconnect()` function is called when a ROSET connection needs to be terminated.
