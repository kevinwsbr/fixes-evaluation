The code you provided appears to be correct and should work as intended. The `WarpinatorLogFormatter` class is a custom logging formatter that formats the log messages in a specific way. It uses the `Gtk.RecentChooserMenu` widget to display the recent files in a menu.

The `add_to_recents_if_single_selection()` function checks if there is only one item in the list of URIs and if so, it adds the first URI from the list to the recent files using the `recent_manager` object. If any exception occurs during this process, it logs a warning message.

The `get_recent_chooser_menu()` function creates a new instance of the `Gtk.RecentChooserMenu` widget and sets its properties accordingly. It returns the created menu object.
