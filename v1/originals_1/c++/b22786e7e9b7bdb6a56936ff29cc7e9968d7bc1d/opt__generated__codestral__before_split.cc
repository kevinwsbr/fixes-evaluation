 This is a source code implementation of the "Split" operation in TensorFlow Lite (TFLite). The "Split" operation divides an input tensor into multiple sub-tensors along a specified axis. This version of the code supports float32, uint8_t, int8_t, int16_t, and int32_t data types for the input tensor.

   Here's a brief overview of how the code works:

   1. The `TfLiteRegistration` struct is defined to register the "Split" operation with TFLite. It contains function pointers for the Prepare and Eval functions that will be called during model execution.

   2. The `Prepare` function is responsible for setting up the operation before it's executed. In this case, it checks if the input tensor's data type is supported (float32, uint8_t, int8_t, int16_t, or int32_t) and sets the output tensors' data types to match the input tensor's data type. It also handles resizing the output tensors based on the provided axis value, either during Prepare (if the axis is a constant tensor) or during Evaluation (if the axis is non-constant).

   3. The `Eval` function is where the actual computation of the "Split" operation occurs. It first checks if the input tensor's data type is supported and then performs the split operation using template metaprogramming to handle different data types efficiently. The result of this operation is stored in the output tensors.

   4. The `TfLiteRegistration` struct is returned from the `Register_SPLIT` function, which allows TFLite to register the "Split" operation with its runtime and use it during model execution.
