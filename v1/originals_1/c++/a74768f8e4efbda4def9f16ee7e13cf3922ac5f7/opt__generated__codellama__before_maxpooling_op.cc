This code defines kernels for the MaxPool operation in TensorFlow. It is using the GPU device, so it is only relevant on platforms that support CUDA or ROCm. The `REGISTER_GPU_NUMBER_TYPES` macro is used to register kernels for different types of data (e.g. float, double, etc.).
The `REGISTER_MAX_POOL_KERNELS` macro is used to define the kernel for the MaxPool operation itself. It specifies that the kernel should be registered for the GPU device and should take a single argument of type `T`. The `REGISTER_GPU_ONLY_POOL_KERNELS` macro is used to define kernels for the MaxPoolV2 and MaxPoolGradGradWithArgmax operations.
The code also includes a few lines that specify kernels for the qint8 data type, which is not included in the original snippet. These kernels are likely to be used when the MaxPool operation is being applied to an image with 8-bit integer pixel values.
