 This is the code for implementing three sparse-dense cwise operations (multiply, divide, and add) on a CPU device in TensorFlow. It uses the Eigen library to perform the operations.

The main function of this code is defined by the `SparseDenseBinaryOpShared` template class. This class takes four parameters: the device type, the data type of the tensors, the functor that defines the operation (multiplication, division, or addition), and a boolean flag indicating whether to use 32-bit indices for sparse tensors. The class contains three methods: `ShapeFromFormat`, which determines the shape of the output tensor based on the input format; `Compute` and `ComputeGradient` methods that perform the forward and backward computations, respectively; and a constructor that sets up the operation object with the given inputs and outputs.

The `REGISTER_KERNELS` macro is used to register the kernels for each of the three operations with TensorFlow's kernel registry. The macro expands to multiple `REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER` statements, each of which creates a new instance of the `SparseDenseBinaryOpShared` template class with the appropriate device type and data type, as well as the corresponding functor for the operation.

Here are some notes on the code:

* The code uses TensorFlow's error reporting mechanism to check that the input tensors have the expected shapes and formats. If an error is encountered, an exception is thrown with an appropriate error message.
* The `SparseTensor` class represents a sparse tensor as a triplet of indices, values, and shape. The code assumes that the sparse tensor's index matrix has two columns: one for row indices and one for column indices.
* The code uses Eigen's Tensor class to represent dense tensors. The `TensorRef` class is used to provide a reference to an existing Tensor object without copying it.
* The code supports sparse tensors with up to 5 dimensions, as specified by the `CASE` macro. If the tensor has more than 5 dimensions, an error is thrown.
* The `dense_gathered_flat` variable is used to store the results of gathering values from the dense side using the indices from the sparse side. This is done in a loop over all non-zero elements in the sparse tensor. For each element, the code looks up its corresponding value in the dense tensor and stores it in `dense_gathered_flat`.
* The output of the operation is then computed by performing an element-wise binary operation between the values from the sparse side and the gathered values from the dense side using Eigen's `binaryExpr` method.
* The code also includes support for computing gradients with respect to the inputs, which is used in backpropagation algorithms. However, this functionality is not fully implemented or documented in the provided code.
