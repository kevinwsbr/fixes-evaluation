  I can see that you've added some additional code to the `initialize` method of the `KronolithCore` object. This code appears to be setting up event handlers for various DOM elements and adding some new methods to the `KronolithCore` object.

The first section of code adds an event handler for the `dom:loaded` event, which will be fired when the page has finished loading. This is used to initialize the `KronolithCore` object and set up any necessary event handlers.

The next section defines a new method called `onDomLoad`, which will be called when the `dom:loaded` event is triggered. This method appears to be setting up some event handlers for various DOM elements, such as the "Search" field and the "Goto Today" button. It also seems to be calling the `updateCalendarList` method of the `KronolithCore` object, which will update the calendar list on the page.

The final section defines an additional event handler for the `Horde_Calendar:select` event, which will be called when a new calendar is selected in the calendar list. This method appears to be updating the `date` property of the `KronolithCore` object with the selected date, and then calling the `updateMinical` method to update the mini-calendar on the page.

Overall, it looks like this code is setting up some basic event handlers for various DOM elements, as well as updating the calendar list and initializing the mini-calendar on the page.
