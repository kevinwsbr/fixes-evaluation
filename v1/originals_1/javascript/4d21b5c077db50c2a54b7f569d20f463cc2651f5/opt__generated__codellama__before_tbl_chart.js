This code appears to be the JavaScript for a web page that displays a chart based on data from a table in a MySQL database. The main purpose of this script is to handle user interactions with the chart, such as changing the title, x-axis labels, y-axis labels, and series selection. It also handles the submission of an SQL query to retrieve the chart data from the database.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. It defines several variables that will be used throughout the script, such as `currentSettings`, `chart_data`, `dateTimeCols`, and `numericCols`.
2. It initializes a few jQuery UI widgets, including the resizable chart area and a Date Picker for the SQL query form.
3. It creates an event handler for the submit button of the SQL query form, which will handle submitting the form to retrieve the chart data from the database.
4. It defines several functions that are called when certain events occur in the chart, such as changing the x-axis or series selection. These functions update the `currentSettings` object with the new settings and call the `drawChart()` function to redraw the chart.
5. It creates an event handler for the `keyup` event of the title input field, which will update the `currentSettings.title` property with the current value of the field and call the `drawChart()` function to redraw the chart.
6. It creates an event handler for the `change` event of the x-axis select menu, which will update the `currentSettings.mainAxis` property with the new selected value and call the `onXAxisChange()` function to handle the change in the x-axis.
7. It creates an event handler for the `change` event of the series selection select menu, which will update the `currentSettings.selectedSeries` property with the new selected value and call the `onDataSeriesChange()` function to handle the change in the series selection.
8. It creates an event handler for the `keyup` event of the x-axis label input field, which will update the `currentSettings.xaxisLabel` property with the current value of the field and call the `drawChart()` function to redraw the chart.
9. It creates an event handler for the `keyup` event of the y-axis label input field, which will update the `currentSettings.yaxisLabel` property with the current value of the field and call the `drawChart()` function to redraw the chart.
10. It initializes the chart data by retrieving it from a JSON object that is sent as part of the AJAX response when the form is submitted. The chart is then drawn using the `drawChart()` function, which is called whenever any of the above event handlers are triggered.
