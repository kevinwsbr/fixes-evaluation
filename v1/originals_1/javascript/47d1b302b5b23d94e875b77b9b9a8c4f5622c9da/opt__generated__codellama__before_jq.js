However, I can help you understand why this code is not working. It appears that you are trying to use the `dojo` library, which is a JavaScript library for creating rich web applications. The code in the snippet you provided is using Dojo's API to create a jQuery-like object and then defining its own methods on top of it.

The issue with this code is that the `dojo` library is not compatible with jQuery, and therefore, the code will not work as expected. When you try to use the `$.getpost()` method, which is defined in the Dojo library, it will not be recognized by the browser because it is not part of the jQuery API.

To fix this issue, you would need to rewrite the code to use the jQuery API instead of the Dojo API. This would involve changing all the instances of `dojo` to `jQuery`, and any other references to Dojo-specific methods to their equivalent in the jQuery library. Additionally, you would need to ensure that all the necessary dependencies for the code are included, as well as any additional plugins or libraries that may be needed to make it work properly.

Overall, while this code is not working as expected, it is a good example of how to use Dojo's API to create a jQuery-like object and extend its functionality. However, in order for the code to work as intended, it would need to be rewritten to use the jQuery API instead of the Dojo API.
