This is a JavaScript code that appears to be related to a chat application. It contains several functions for sending and receiving messages, as well as handling the data channel used for real-time communication. The code also includes some helper functions for formatting dates and escaping XML tags.

Here are some key points about this code:

* `sendPrivateMsg` is called when a user clicks on a private message button. It prompts the user to enter a message, which it then sends to the server using the `data` method of the `textroom` object. The message is sent in JSON format and includes information about the sender and recipient.
* `sendData` is called when a user clicks on a "Send" button. It prompts the user to enter some data, which it then sends to the server using the `data` method of the `textroom` object. The data is sent in JSON format and includes information about the sender and recipient.
* `getDateString` is a helper function that takes a date object as input and returns a string representation of the date in the format "HH:MM:SS". If no date is provided, it uses the current date and time.
* `randomString` is a helper function that generates a random alphanumeric string of a specified length. It takes an optional character set parameter, which specifies the characters to use for generating the string (defaults to "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789" if not provided).
* `getQueryStringValue` is a helper function that retrieves the value of a query string parameter. It takes the name of the parameter as input and returns its value, or an empty string if it could not be found.
* `escapeXmlTags` is a helper function that escapes XML tags in a string. If no string is provided, it returns an empty string.
