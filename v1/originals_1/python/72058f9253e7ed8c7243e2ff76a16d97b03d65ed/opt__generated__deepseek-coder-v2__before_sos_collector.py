 The provided Python code snippet is part of a larger script that likely belongs to a tool or application for collecting sosreports from multiple nodes in a distributed system, such as a cluster or network of machines. This script uses the `ThreadPoolExecutor` class from the `concurrent.futures` module to manage and execute tasks concurrently across multiple threads.

Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

1. **Initialization and ThreadPoolExecutor**:
   - The script initializes a `ThreadPoolExecutor` with a number of threads specified by `self.config['threads']`.
   - It then uses `pool.map(self._connect_to_node, nodes, chunksize=1)` to map the `_connect_to_node` method across each node in the list `nodes`, processing them one at a time (`chunksize=1`).
   - After completing the connection phase, it shuts down the thread pool and waits for all tasks to complete.

2. **Collection of sosreports**:
   - It updates the report number based on the length of `self.client_list`.
   - It logs a message indicating that collection is beginning, specifying how many nodes are being processed concurrently (`self.config['threads']`).
   - Another `ThreadPoolExecutor` instance is created to handle the collection process for each client in `self.client_list`, again processing them one at a time (`chunksize=1`).
   - After completing the collection phase, it shuts down the thread pool and waits for all tasks to complete.

3. **Handling KeyboardInterrupt**:
   - If the user interrupts the process (e.g., using Ctrl+C), it logs an error message and exits immediately with a status code 130.

4. **Extra Data Collection**:
   - It checks if `self.config['cluster']` has an attribute `run_extra_cmd`. If so, it collects additional data from the master node using this method.
   - If the collection is successful and results are obtained, they are passed to `self.master.collect_extra_cmd()`.

5. **Reporting and Archiving**:
   - It logs a success message indicating how many sosreports were collected (`%s of %s`).
   - If any reports were retrieved, it calls `create_cluster_archive()` to create an archive of the collected sosreports.
   - If no reports were collected, it logs a specific message and does nothing.

6. **Cleanup**:
   - The script defines a method `_collect` for running sosreport on each node. It handles non-local nodes by calling `client.sosreport()` and ensures that local nodes are processed only if `self.config['no_local']` is not set to True.
   - The script includes methods `close_all_connections`, `create_cluster_archive`, and `cleanup` for managing SSH connections, creating archives, and cleaning up temporary files, respectively.

7. **Helper Methods**:
   - `_collect`: Runs sosreport on each node.
   - `close_all_connections`: Closes all SSH sessions to nodes.
   - `create_cluster_archive`: Creates a tar archive of the collected sosreports and logs information about the created archive.
   - `create_sos_archive`: Helper method for creating an archive of collected sosreports, including renaming log files as necessary.
   - `cleanup`: Removes temporary directories or specific sosreport archives based on user configuration.

Overall, this script is designed to efficiently gather and organize diagnostic information from multiple nodes in a distributed system, using multithreading to handle parallel operations, and providing robust error handling and cleanup mechanisms.
