This method is responsible for creating a tar archive containing all the sosreports collected during the collection process. It uses the `tarfile` module to create the archive, and it iterates over all the files in the temporary directory to add them to the archive. The archive file is created with the name specified by the `archive` attribute, which is set in the `__init__` method of this class.

The method first checks if the tmp dir was created internally, and if so, it deletes the entire directory using the `delete_tmp_dir` method. If the tmp dir was supplied by the user, only the sosreports within that directory are removed.

Once the tmp directory is cleaned up, the method creates a new tar archive with the name specified in the `archive` attribute. It then iterates over all the files in the temporary directory and adds them to the archive using the `tar.add()` method from the `tarfile` module. The archive file is closed after all the files have been added.

The method logs a message indicating that an archive has been created, and it also returns the name of the archive as its return value.
