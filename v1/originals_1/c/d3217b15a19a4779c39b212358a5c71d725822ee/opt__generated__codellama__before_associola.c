  This is a function in the Linux kernel's implementation of the SCTP protocol that frees an association's ASCONF queue and ASCONF-ACK cache. The ASCONF queue stores chunks to be sent, while the ASCONF-ACK cache stores acknowledgments received from the peer for previously sent ASCONF chunks. 
  
  This function first clears the ASCONF queue by removing all chunks and freeing them using sctp_chunk_free. Then it clears the ASCONF-ACK cache by removing all chunks and freeing them using sctp_chunk_free. Lastly, it frees any cached ASCONF chunk using sctp_chunk_free. 
  
  The function also frees any cached ASCONF-ACK chunk using sctp_chunk_free.

This function takes a pointer to the association (struct sctp_association *asoc) as input, which contains the list of chunks that need to be sent and the acknowledgments received from the peer. It returns no value.
