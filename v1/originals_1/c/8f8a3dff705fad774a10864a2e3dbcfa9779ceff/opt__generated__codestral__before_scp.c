 This code is a part of the OpenSSH project and it appears to be a component of an implementation of the `scp` command, which stands for "Secure Copy". The file is written in C and provides functions for handling input/output operations, error reporting, user name validation, buffer allocation, and connection loss.

   Here's a brief summary of what each function does:

1. `usage()`: Prints the usage instructions for the `scp` command and exits the program with a non-zero status code.
2. `run_err(const char *fmt,...)`: Reports an error by writing to both stderr and the output stream (if not in remote mode). The error message is prefixed with "scp:" and followed by a newline character. The function also increments a global error counter.
3. `verifydir(char *cp)`: Verifies that a given path is a directory. If it's not, the function prints an error message to stderr, writes an error message to the output stream, and terminates the program with a non-zero status code.
4. `okname(char *cp0)`: Checks if a given string contains only valid characters for a username (alphanumeric or certain special characters). If it does not, the function prints an error message to stderr and returns 0. Otherwise, the function returns 1.
5. `allocbuf(BUF *bp, int fd, int blksize)`: Allocates a buffer of size equal to the block size of the file descriptor `fd`, or `blksize` if the block size cannot be determined. The buffer is allocated using `xmalloc()` and initialized to zero. If the buffer was already allocated with a smaller size, it is resized using `xrealloc()`.
6. `lostconn(int signo)`: Handles connection loss by writing an error message to stderr (if not in remote mode), and then exiting the program with a non-zero status code if called as a signal handler (i.e., `signo` is non-zero). If called directly, the function calls `exit()` instead of `_exit()`.
