 This is a function that cleans up and frees memory used by the `airodump` program. It takes no arguments and returns an integer status code.

The function first sets the `G.record_data` flag to false, which signals that data collection should be stopped. It then frees various resources used by the program, including:

* The `G.f_cap_name` buffer, which contains the file name of the capture file being written.
* The `G.keyout` buffer, which contains the contents of the key output file.
* The `G.f_txt`, `G.f_kis`, and `G.f_kis_xml` files, which contain data about the captured networks in various formats.
* The `G.airodump_start_time` buffer, which contains the time at which airodump was started.
* The `G.f_gps` file, which contains GPS coordinates for each network that has been seen.
* The `G.f_cap` file, which contains captured packets in a format compatible with Wireshark.
* The `G.f_ivs` file, which contains information about the IVs used by each network.

The function then cleans up memory used by the various linked lists and buffers that were created during program execution. It does this by calling the following functions:

* `list_tail_free()` to free the packets linked list in each AP structure.
* `uniqueiv_wipe()` to free the unique IV list in each AP structure.
* `data_wipe()` to free the anomaly detection data in each AP structure.
* `free()` to free the memory used by various structures and buffers.

Finally, the function sets the `G.record_data` flag back to false, which signals that data collection has stopped. It then returns an integer status code of 0.
