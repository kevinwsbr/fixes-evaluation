 This function is responsible for cleaning up and freeing memory allocated during the execution of a program. It performs various tasks such as closing file descriptors, freeing dynamically allocated memory, and handling linked lists. Here's a breakdown of what the function does:

1. Frees the memory allocated for `G.prefix`.
2. If `G.f_cap_name` is not NULL, it frees the memory allocated for it.
3. If `G.keyout` is not NULL, it frees the memory allocated for it.
4. In case of using PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions), if `G.f_essid_regex` is not NULL, it frees the memory allocated for it.
5. Closes file descriptors and handles associated resources for each card in `wi`.
6. If `G.record_data` is true, it writes data to files based on the output formats specified (CSV, Kismet CSV, Kismet NetXML) and closes these file descriptors.
7. Depending on whether `G.save_gps` is true or false, it either removes or keeps the GPS file associated with the current index.
8. It iterates through the list of APs (Access Points), freeing memory allocated for unique IVs and data if necessary, and then frees each AP structure.
9. Similarly, it iterates through the lists of stations and non-associated clients, freeing memory associated with each node in these lists.
10. If a list of manufacturers is present (`G.manufList`), it frees memory allocated for this list.
11. Finally, it resets the terminal to its original state by enabling cursor display and flushing the output buffer.
