**Code Overview**

The code snippet you provided is a C function that performs cleanup and frees memory allocated during a network scanning process. It handles the following tasks:

- Frees memory for various variables and data structures.
- Closes open network interfaces.
- Writes captured data to output files in different formats.
- Cleans and frees memory associated with AP and station information.

**Key Functions and Steps**

- **Memory Cleanup:**
    - Frees memory for various variables, including channel list, ESSID, prefix, keyout, and compiled regular expression.
- **Interface Closure:**
    - Closes all open network interfaces.
- **Data Output:**
    - Writes captured data to CSV, Kismet CSV, and Kismet NetXML files, if specified.
- **Data Cleanup:**
    - Clears unique identifier lists (UIDLs) for each AP.
    - Frees memory for each AP's packet list and manufacturer information.
    - Clears anomaly data for each AP.
- **AP List Cleanup:**
    - Frees each AP node in the linked list.
- **Station List Cleanup:**
    - Frees each station node in the linked list.
- **AP Interface List Cleanup:**
    - Frees each network interface node in the linked list.
- **Manufacturer List Cleanup:**
    - Frees each manufacturer node in the linked list.

**Additional Notes**

- The code uses several data structures and variables, such as `G`, `ap_cur`, `st_cur`, `na_cur`, and `oui_cur`.
- The `dump_write_*` functions are responsible for writing captured data to different formats.
- The code uses the `fprintf` function to output a message to the standard error stream.

**Conclusion**

The code snippet provides a comprehensive mechanism for cleaning up memory and releasing resources used during a network scanning process. It ensures that all allocated memory is freed and resources are properly closed, preventing memory leaks and ensuring efficient program termination.
