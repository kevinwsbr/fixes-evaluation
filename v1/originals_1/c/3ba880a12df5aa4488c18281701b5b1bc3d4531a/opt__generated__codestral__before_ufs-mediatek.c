 It seems like you've shared a piece of a Linux driver code for the MediaTek Universal Flash Storage (UFS) host controller. This driver is implemented as a platform driver and it handles the probing, removal, and power management operations for UFS devices. The probe function initializes the driver by finding compatible nodes in the device tree and adding device links if necessary. It then calls the generic UFS host controller driver (ufshcd) init function to initialize the UFS host controller. If the initialization fails, an error message is printed. The remove function deinitializes the UFS host controller by calling the ufshcd_remove function.

The driver also defines a set of power management operations for handling system and runtime suspend/resume events. These operations are used to prepare the driver for sleep and to complete the resume operation, respectively.
