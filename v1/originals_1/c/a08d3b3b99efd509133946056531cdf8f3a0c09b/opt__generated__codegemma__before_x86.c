**Purpose:**

The code snippet provides functions and symbols for managing asynchronous page faults (APFs) in the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) hypervisor. APFs are used to handle memory accesses that access virtual memory pages that are not present in the guest machine.

**Functions:**

- `kvm_arch_async_page_not_present()`: Injects a page fault for a virtual memory page that is not present.
- `kvm_arch_async_page_present()`: Indicates that a virtual memory page is now present.
- `kvm_arch_can_inject_async_page_present()`: Checks if it is possible to inject an APF for a page present event.
- `kvm_arch_register_noncoherent_dma()`: Increments a counter for non-coherent DMA operations.
- `kvm_arch_unregister_noncoherent_dma()`: Decrements a counter for non-coherent DMA operations.
- `kvm_arch_has_noncoherent_dma()`: Checks if there are any non-coherent DMA operations in progress.

**Tracepoints:**

The code exports tracepoints for various events related to APFs, such as:

- KVM exit
- Interrupt injection
- Page faults
- MSR updates
- CR register updates
- Nested VM run/exit events
- Invalidation of physical pages
- SKINIT operation
- Nested intercepts
- Writing TSC offset

**Usage:**

These functions and tracepoints can be used to:

- Monitor APF events in the guest machine.
- Investigate performance or debugging issues related to APFs.
- Enhance the guest machine's performance by optimizing APF handling.

**Conclusion:**

The code provides a comprehensive set of functions and symbols for managing APFs in KVM. By using these features, developers can efficiently handle APFs and improve the overall performance of their virtual machines.
