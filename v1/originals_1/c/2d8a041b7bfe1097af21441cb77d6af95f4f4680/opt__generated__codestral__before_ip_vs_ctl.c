 The provided code snippet appears to be a part of an IP Virtual Server (IPVS) implementation for the Linux kernel. The IPVS is a layer-4 load balancing mechanism that provides high performance and scalability.

The `ip_vs_control_net_init` function initializes network-specific data structures, such as locks, lists, and statistics, for managing IPVS services and real servers. It also creates the necessary procfs entries for displaying IPVS information and sets up system control parameters for the network namespace.

The `ip_vs_control_net_cleanup` function cleans up these data structures and resources allocated during initialization when a network namespace is destroyed or disabled.

Additionally, the code registers and unregisters the necessary socket options and Generic Netlink interfaces used for IPVS configuration and monitoring through the `ip_vs_register_nl_ioctl` and `ip_vs_unregister_nl_ioctl` functions, respectively.

Finally, the `ip_vs_control_init` function initializes global data structures, such as service tables and real server tables, used for managing IPVS services. The `ip_vs_control_cleanup` function cleans up these resources when the module is unloaded from the kernel.
