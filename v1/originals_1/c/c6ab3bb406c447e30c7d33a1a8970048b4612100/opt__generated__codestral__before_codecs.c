 The provided code is written in C and it's part of a larger program that handles SIP messages. This specific function, `handle_streams`, takes a SIP message, two regular expressions (regex), and a delete flag as input. It parses the SDP (Session Description Protocol) from the SIP message and searches for a stream that matches the given regex patterns.

Here's a breakdown of what each part of the code does:

1. Check if the message has SDP, return -1 if it doesn't.
2. Iterate through all sessions in the SDP, and within those sessions, iterate through all streams.
3. For each stream, check if its media type matches the first regex (`re`). If a match is found, optionally check the transport against the second regex (`re2`).
4. If both checks pass, the matching stream is either returned (if `delete` flag is 0) or deleted from the message (if `delete` flag is 1).
5. When deleting a stream, it searches for the beginning and end of the stream's content in the SDP and removes it.
6. If no matching stream is found, -1 is returned.
