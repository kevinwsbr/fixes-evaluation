**Purpose:**

The provided code snippet implements a function called `gf_isom_scene_description_insert()` for generating Scene Description (SD) information for an ISO Media file. It handles the encoding and embedding of SD samples in the file.

**Function Functionality:**

- Reads and processes scene description samples from the input file.
- Extracts the scene time, resolution, and other relevant data.
- Creates an Extended Stream Descriptor (ESD) for the scene description.
- Encodes the ESD in Base64 and includes it in the ISO Media file's SDP line.

**Steps:**

1. Reads scene description samples using `gf_isom_sample_read()`.
2. Extracts scene time, resolution, and other data from each sample.
3. Creates an ESD with the extracted data.
4. Encodes the ESD in Base64.
5. Adds a SDP line to the ISO Media file containing the Base64-encoded ESD.

**Key Points:**

- The function uses the `gf_isom_set_extraction_slc()` function to set the scene resolution for future extraction.
- The `gf_base64_encode()` function is used to convert the ESD to Base64 encoding.
- The SD information is included in the SDP line with the tag `a=mpeg4-iod`.

**Usage:**

The `gf_isom_scene_description_insert()` function can be called within a ISO Media file processing workflow to add SD information to the file.
