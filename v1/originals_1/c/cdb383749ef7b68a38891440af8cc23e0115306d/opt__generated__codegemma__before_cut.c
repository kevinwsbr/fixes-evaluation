**Image Format Detection for CUT Images**

The provided code snippet is responsible for detecting monochrome images in the CUT format. Here's a breakdown of the code:

**Purpose:**

- The code detects monochrome (binary) images in the CUT image format.
- It checks for certain conditions to determine if an image is monochrome:
    - The image is in PseudoClass storage class.
    - The image has only two colors in its colormap.
    - Each color in the colormap has the same value.

**Steps:**

1. **Image Colormap Check:**
    - The code iterates through the colormap of the image.
    - It checks if each color has the same red, green, and blue values.
    - If all colors have the same values, the image is potentially monochrome.

2. **Pixel Value Check:**
    - If the colormap check succeeds, the code iterates through each pixel in the image.
    - It checks if the red, green, and blue values of each pixel match the value of the second color in the colormap.
    - If all pixels match the second color, the image is confirmed to be monochrome.

**Code Explanation:**

- The code starts with a call to `SetImageGray()` to convert the image to grayscale.
- It then checks for the conditions mentioned above.
- If the conditions are met, the image is marked as monochrome and the colormap is modified to set the second color to white.
- The code handles errors and closes the image file.

**Conclusion:**

The code snippet effectively detects monochrome CUT images by analyzing the colormap and pixel values. It sets the image as monochrome and modifies the colormap accordingly.
