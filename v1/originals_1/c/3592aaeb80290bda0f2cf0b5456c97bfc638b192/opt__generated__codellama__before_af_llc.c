This code is a module for the Linux kernel that initializes and registers the LLC protocol family, along with various other components necessary for the proper functioning of the protocol. The `llc2_init` function is called when the module is loaded, and it performs several tasks:

1. It registers the `llc_proto` structure as a protocol in the kernel using the `proto_register` function.
2. It initializes the LLC station tables with the `llc_station_init` function.
3. It sets up the proc filesystem entries for the LLC module using the `llc_proc_init` function.
4. It sets up the sysctl interface for the LLC module using the `llc_sysctl_init` function.
5. It registers the PF_LLC protocol family using the `sock_register` function.
6. It adds two destination SAPs to the LLC packet handler using the `llc_add_pack` function, one for the LLC protocol and one for the LLC connection protocol.

The `llc2_exit` function is called when the module is unloaded and it performs the following tasks:

1. It removes the two destination SAPs from the LLC packet handler using the `llc_remove_pack` function.
2. It unregisters the PF_LLC protocol family using the `sock_unregister` function.
3. It cleans up the proc filesystem entries for the LLC module using the `llc_proc_exit` function.
4. It cleans up the sysctl interface for the LLC module using the `llc_sysctl_exit` function.
5. It unregisters the `llc_proto` structure from the kernel using the `proto_unregister` function.
