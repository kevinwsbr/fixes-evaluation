This is an example of a code snippet in C that defines a decoder for the Chronomaster DFA video format. The `dfa_decode_init` function initializes the decoder by allocating memory for the frame buffer and setting up other necessary data structures. The `dfa_decode_end` function releases any resources allocated during initialization.
The `dfa_decode_frame` function is where the decoding logic actually happens. It takes an AVPacket as input and outputs a frame of video data. It first checks if there are enough bytes in the packet to read the chunk header and then processes each chunk type in order. Chunk types 1-4 correspond to Palette, Background Color, Foreground Color, and Luma Data respectively. If a chunk type is not recognized or is malformed, the function returns an error.
The `dfa_decode` struct defines the decoder itself, with its name, long name, media type, codec ID, private data size (which should be enough to store a DfaContext), and initialization and release functions.
