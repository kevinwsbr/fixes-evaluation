 This is a Linux kernel module for the Marvell NFC (Near Field Communication) driver. The module provides functionality to register and unregister an NFC device, receive frames of data, reset and halt the chip, and parse device tree information for configuration.

The `nfcmrvl_nci_register_dev` function initializes the NFC device by parsing platform data, requesting GPIO pins, allocating memory for private data, registering the device with NCI (Near-field Communication Interface), and starting a firmware download if necessary.

The `nfcmrvl_nci_unregister_dev` function cleans up resources when the NFC device is unregistered. It aborts any ongoing firmware download, deinitializes the firmware downloader, frees GPIO pins, unregisters the device from NCI, and frees allocated memory.

The `nfcmrvl_nci_recv_frame` function receives a frame of data from the NFC chip. If the chip is configured for HCI (Host Controller Interface) muxing, it extracts the NCI payload from the frame. If there's an ongoing firmware download, it passes the frame to the firmware downloader. Otherwise, if the NFC device is running, it passes the frame to the NCI layer for processing.

The `nfcmrvl_chip_reset` and `nfcmrvl_chip_halt` functions reset and halt the NFC chip, respectively, using a GPIO pin if configured.

The `nfcmrvl_parse_dt` function parses device tree information to configure the NFC driver. It retrieves the GPIO pin for resetting the chip and checks whether HCI muxing is enabled.

Overall, this module provides the necessary functionality for initializing, configuring, and communicating with a Marvell NFC chip using the Linux kernel's NCI layer.
