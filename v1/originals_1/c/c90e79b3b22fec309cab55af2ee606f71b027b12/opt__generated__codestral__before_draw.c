 This function is responsible for creating a new stroke outline around the given polygon primitive. It performs these tasks:

   1. Calculate the control points (stroke_p and stroke_q) of the polygon based on the width, line cap, and line join properties.
   2. For each edge in the polygon, it calculates the intersection with a circle of radius equal to half the stroke width centered at that edge's midpoint. This results in the creation of circular arcs which form the outline of the stroke.
   3. If the path is closed (i.e., the first and last vertices are connected), it ensures that the start point of the stroke matches its end point to create a continuous, closed shape.
   4. Finally, it returns a new PrimitiveInfo array containing all the points for the stroked polygon, including the original polygon's points with appropriate line caps applied at each vertex.

   The function uses several helper functions and structures such as `PointInfo`, `PrimitiveInfo`, and `DegreesToRadians` to perform these calculations. If any error occurs during memory allocation for new arrays or primitives, it throws a MagickException with an appropriate error message.
