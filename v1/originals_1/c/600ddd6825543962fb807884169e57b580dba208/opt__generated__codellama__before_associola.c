  This code implements the functions for handling the ASCONF queue and the ASCONF_ACK cache. It creates a new association ID using the idr allocator, adds the new association to the idr, and then initializes the ASCONF queue and the ASCONF_ACK cache for the new association.

The first function is sctp_assoc_new_id(), which is called whenever a new SCTP association needs to be created. It locks the spinlock associated with the idr, allocates a new id using the idr_alloc_cyclic() function, and then unlocks the spinlock. The new id is assigned to the sctp_association structure as its association ID.

The second function is sctp_assoc_free_asconf_acks(), which frees all the cached ASCONF_ACK chunks in an SCTP association. It uses the list_for_each_entry() macro to iterate over each entry in the association's asconf_ack_list and calls the sctp_chunk_free() function for each entry.

The third function is sctp_assoc_clean_asconf_ack_cache(), which cleans up the ASCONF_ACK queue of an SCTP association by removing all entries whose serial number matches the peer's sequence number. It uses the list_for_each_entry() macro to iterate over each entry in the association's asconf_ack_list and calls the sctp_chunk_free() function for each entry that matches the condition.

The fourth function is sctp_assoc_lookup_asconf_ack(), which looks up an ASCONF_ACK chunk with a given serial number in the association's asconf_ack_list. It uses the list_for_each_entry() macro to iterate over each entry in the association's asconf_ack_list and returns the first matching chunk that it finds. If no matching chunks are found, it returns NULL.
