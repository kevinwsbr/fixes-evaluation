**imagetoraw() and imagetorawl() Functions**

These functions are part of an open-source library for image compression and encoding. They are responsible for converting an image to a raw byte stream.

**imagetoraw()** function:
- Converts an image to a raw byte stream with lossless compression.
- Writes the raw data to a file specified by the `outfile` parameter.

**imagetorawl()** function:
- Converts an image to a raw byte stream with lossy compression.
- Writes the raw data to a file specified by the `outfile` parameter.

**Parameters:**
- `image`: A pointer to an `opj_image_t` structure representing the image to convert.
- `outfile`: A string containing the name of the output file.

**Return Value:**
- The `imagetoraw()` and `imagetorawl()` functions return an integer value indicating the number of failures encountered during the conversion process.

**Code Breakdown:**

The `imagetoraw_common()` function is responsible for the actual conversion process. It takes three parameters:

- `image`: The image to convert.
- `outfile`: The name of the output file.
- `lossless`: A boolean value indicating whether to use lossless or lossy compression.

**Conversion Process:**

- The function iterates through each color component in the image.
- Based on the precision and sign of the component, it writes the pixel values to the raw file in the appropriate format (8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit).
- The `fwrite()` function is used to write the raw data to the file.

**Error Handling:**

- If any errors occur during the conversion process, the function logs an error message and returns a failure code.

**Additional Notes:**

- The `opj_image_t` structure represents an image and contains information about its components, dimensions, and color space.
- The `lossless` parameter determines whether the compression used is lossless (preserving all image data) or lossy (compressing the image with some data loss).
- The raw byte stream format used by these functions is specific to the image compression library being used.
