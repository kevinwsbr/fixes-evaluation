 The provided code is a part of a larger C program that processes an image (represented by `opj_image_t` structure) and writes its pixel data to a raw file. The function `imagetoraw_common` handles the conversion of the image's components to raw format based on their precision and signedness, then writes the pixel data to a file.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of what the code does:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `int imagetoraw_common(opj_image_t * image, const char *outfile, int isBigEndian)`: This function converts an OpenJPEG image to raw format and writes it to a file. It handles both big-endian (`isBigEndian = 1`) and little-endian (`isBigEndian = 0`) byte orders.
   - `int imagetoraw(opj_image_t * image, const char *outfile)`: This is a wrapper function that calls `imagetoraw_common` with `isBigEndian` set to `OPJ_TRUE`.
   - `int imagetorawl(opj_image_t * image, const char *outfile)`: This is another wrapper function that calls `imagetoraw_common` with `isBigEndian` set to `OPJ_FALSE`.

2. **Main Conversion Logic**:
   - The function iterates over each component of the image (`compno`), checking its precision and signedness.
   - For 8-bit unsigned data, it directly writes the pixel values to the file after clamping them within the range [0, 255].
   - For other precisions (16 bits and above), it uses a union to handle different endianess by reading the data as `signed short` or `unsigned short` depending on whether the component is signed. It then writes these values to the file in either big-endian or little-endian format.
   - If the precision exceeds 16 bits, it reports an error and exits.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - The function handles errors by printing an error message and setting a failure flag (`fails`). It uses `fprintf(stderr, ...)` to output messages to standard error.
   - If any write operation fails (checked using `if (res < 1)`), it prints a specific error message indicating the file that failed to write to, then jumps to the end of the function to clean up and return with an error status.

4. **File Handling**:
   - The function opens the output file for writing at the beginning (`fopen(outfile, "wb")`) and closes it after all writes are complete (`fclose(rawFile)`).

5. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns `0` if successful, otherwise it returns a non-zero value indicating failure.

This code is part of a larger library that likely handles various image formats supported by OpenJPEG and converts them to raw format for further processing or storage.
