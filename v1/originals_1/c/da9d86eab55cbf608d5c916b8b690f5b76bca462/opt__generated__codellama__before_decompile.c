  This is a long function, but it's relatively straightforward. It takes several parameters:
  
  1. n - the number of actions in the SWF_ACTION array
  2. actions - an array of SWF_ACTION structures to be decompiled
  3. maxn - the maximum index that can be used for the actions array (i.e., the length of the array)
  4. indent - the number of spaces to use for indentation when printing the decompiled code

The function starts by initializing a few variables:

* pool - an array of strings to use as temporary storage for various purposes during decompilation
* poolcounter - the number of elements in the pool array that are currently used
* regs - an array of variable names, each with a unique index (1-256), to be used for registers in the decompiled code
* gIndent - the current indentation level

The function then iterates over each action in the actions array, using the decompileAction() function to decompile it. If there are any errors during decompilation, they are printed to stderr.

Once all the actions have been decompiled, the function checks if there is anything left on the stack. If so, it prints a warning message indicating that some stuff was left on the stack at the end of a block of actions. This is not necessarily an error, but it can be confusing if it happens.

Finally, the function returns the decompiled code as a string.
