The purpose of the `WriteTIFFImage` function is to write an image to a TIFF file. This function takes several parameters:

1. `image`: The image that needs to be written to the TIFF file.
2. `filename`: The name of the output file.
3. `adjoin`: If this value is MagickTrue, the image sequence will be saved in a single TIFF file with multiple images. Otherwise, each image in the sequence will be written to a separate file named `filename-0`, `filename-1`, etc.
4. `compression`: The compression algorithm used for the TIFF file. This can have any of the values listed in the [TIFF documentation](https://libvips.github.io/libvips/API/current/tiff-enums.html#VipsCompression).
5. `quality`: The quality setting to use when compressing the image. A higher value typically results in a smaller and more compressed output file, but may also result in visible artifacts.
6. `type`: The type of TIFF file that will be written. This can have any of the values listed in the [TIFF documentation](https://libvips.github.io/libvips/API/current/tiff-enums.html#VipsForeignTiffFile).
7. `profile`: The ICC profile to write to the TIFF file. If this parameter is not specified, then any existing profile attached to the input image will be written to the output file.

The function first checks if an image has been supplied and if so, it sets up a TIFF file stream with the appropriate settings and parameters. It then iterates over each frame in the image sequence, converts the images to the TIFF format, and writes them to the output file using the `TIFFWriteEncodedStrip` function from the LibTIFF library. After all the images have been written, it closes the TIFF file stream with `TIFFClose`.

The `quantum_info` variable is used to store information about the pixel format of each image in the sequence and the `tiff_info` variable is used to store information about the TIFF file that will be written. These variables are later destroyed using the `DestroyQuantumInfo` and `DestroyTIFFInfo` functions, respectively.

The function returns MagickTrue if all the images in the sequence were successfully written to the output file, otherwise it returns MagickFalse and sets the exception information accordingly.
