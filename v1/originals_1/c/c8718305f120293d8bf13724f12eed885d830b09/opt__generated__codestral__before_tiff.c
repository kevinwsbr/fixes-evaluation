 This code is a function to save an image in the TIFF format. It first checks if there are any NULL pointers for red, green, and blue arrays that will be used to store color map data. If any of these pointers are NULL, it frees up the memory that has been allocated so far and throws an exception.

   After initializing the TIFF colormap with zeros, it iterates through the image colors and assigns the scaled values of red, green, and blue from the image's color map to the corresponding arrays. It then sets the TIFF field for the color map using these arrays.

   Depending on the image type, the function either writes a single tile or converts PseudoClass packets to contiguous grayscale scanlines and writes them to the file. The progress of the save operation is updated as it goes along. Finally, it closes the TIFF file and returns the status of the save operation.
