**Purpose**

The provided code snippet contains functions for SMB2 lock management and lease break operations in a CIFS client.

**Key Functions**

- `smb2_lockv()`: Sends a LOCK request to the SMB2 server, specifying the persistent and volatile file IDs, process ID, number of locks, and lock elements.
- `SMB2_lock()`: Creates a single lock element and calls `smb2_lockv()` to perform the lock operation.
- `SMB2_lease_break()`: Sends a Lease Break request to the SMB2 server, providing the lease key and lease state.

**Usage**

The `SMB2_lock()` function can be used to acquire file locks with different flags, such as read-only, write-exclusive, and shared. The `SMB2_lease_break()` function can be used to break an active lease on a file.

**Code Analysis**

- The functions use the `cifs_stats_inc()` and `cifs_stats_fail_inc()` macros to track statistics related to lock operations.
- The `SendReceive2()` function is used to send the SMB2 requests and receive the responses.
- The `small_smb2_init()` function initializes the SMB2 request structure.
- The `inc_rfc1001_len()` function adjusts the request length field in the SMB2 header.

**Conclusion**

The provided code provides a mechanism for SMB2 lock management and lease break operations in a CIFS client. It includes functions for acquiring locks with different flags and breaking active leases.
