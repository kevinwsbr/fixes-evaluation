 These two functions, `RegisterRLEImage` and `UnregisterRLEImage`, are part of a module in an image processing library that deals with the RLE (Run Length Encoding) image format. They register and unregister the RLE format with the library, allowing it to handle RLE images correctly when they are encountered during image operations.

### RegisterRLEImage Function
This function is responsible for adding information about the RLE image format to the list of supported formats in the library. It does this by creating a new entry in the `MagickInfo` structure and registering it with the library using `RegisterMagickInfo`. The steps include:
1. **Creating a MagickInfo Entry**: A new entry is created for the RLE format, which includes details like the image format tag (`"RLE"`), a brief description (`"Utah Run length encoded image"`), and pointers to functions that handle reading and writing the format.
2. **Setting Up Handlers**: The `decoder` field in the MagickInfo entry is set to point to a function that can read RLE images, and the `magick` field is set to another function that identifies RLE image files. Additionally, the `flags` are adjusted to exclude a specific flag (`CoderAdjoinFlag`), which might have been included by default.
3. **Registering with the Library**: The entry is then registered with the library using `RegisterMagickInfo`, making it available for use in all subsequent operations that involve image handling and manipulation.

### UnregisterRLEImage Function
This function is used to remove the RLE format registration from the list of supported formats. It effectively unregisters the format, ensuring that future operations will no longer recognize or be able to handle RLE images unless explicitly re-registered by calling `RegisterRLEImage` again. The function does this by invoking `UnregisterMagickInfo` with the tag associated with the RLE format (`"RLE"`), thus removing all related information from the library's internal registry of supported formats.

### Summary
- **RegisterRLEImage**: Adds an entry for handling RLE images in the image processing library, specifying how to decode and identify these files.
- **UnregisterRLEImage**: Removes this registration, effectively disabling support for RLE images unless explicitly reintroduced by another call to `RegisterRLEImage`.

These functions are crucial for managing and extending the functionality of an image processing library to include support for specific file formats like RLE, ensuring that users can load and save these formats as needed.
