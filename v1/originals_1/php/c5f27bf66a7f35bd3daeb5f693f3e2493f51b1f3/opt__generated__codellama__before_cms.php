This is a PHP class that provides methods for working with URLs and HTML. The class defines several methods, including `getInternalPageLink()`, `replaceInternalPageLinks()`, `replaceRelativeRoots()`, and `urlify()`.

* `getInternalPageLink()` takes an internal page link in the form of "ipl://" followed by a URL path, and returns the hard-linked URL. For example, if the input is "ipl://some/path", it would return "/admin/some/path".
* `replaceInternalPageLinks()` replaces all internal page links in an HTML block with their corresponding hard-linked URLs. The method takes a single parameter, which is the HTML block to be processed. If the input string is empty or not a valid HTML block, it returns an empty string.
* `replaceRelativeRoots()` replaces all relative roots (e.g. {wwwroot}, {adminroot}, etc.) in a URL with their corresponding hard-linked URLs. The method takes a single parameter, which is the input URL to be processed. If the input URL is empty or not a valid URL, it returns an empty string.
* `urlify()` turns a short string into one suited for URL routes. The method takes a single parameter, which is the input string to be processed. It replaces all spaces with dashes (-), removes any non-alphanumeric characters except underscores and dashes, and converts all letters to lowercase. If the input string is empty or not a valid URL, it returns an empty string.

These methods are useful for creating dynamic HTML pages that can be easily updated without having to modify the source code.
