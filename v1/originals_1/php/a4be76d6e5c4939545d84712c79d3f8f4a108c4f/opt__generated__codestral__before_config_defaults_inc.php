 It appears that you're looking at a configuration file for MantisBT, an open-source issue tracking system. Here's a brief explanation of the options in the provided code:

1. `$g_webservice_readwrite_access_level_threshold`: This is the minimum global access level required to have read and write access to the webservices. In this case, it's set to REPORTER, which means that any user with the reporter role or higher can use these services.
2. `$g_webservice_admin_access_level_threshold`: This is the minimum global access level required to have administrator-level access to the webservices. In this case, it's set to MANAGER, which means that users with the manager role or higher can use these services.
3. `$g_webservice_specify_reporter_on_add_access_level_threshold`: This is the minimum project access level required for a user to specify a reporter when adding an issue. Users who don't have this access level will still be able to add issues, but they will automatically be assigned as the reporter. In this case, it's set to DEVELOPER.
4. The next few options (`$g_webservice_priority_enum_default_when_not_found`, `$g_webservice_severity_enum_default_when_not_found`, etc.) are used when the webservices get enum labels that are not defined in the associated MantisBT installation. In this case, the enum id is set to the value specified by the corresponding configuration option.
5. `$g_webservice_error_when_version_not_found`: If this option is ON and the supplied version is not found, then a SoapException will be raised. If it's OFF, then a default version will be used instead. In this case, it's set to ON.
6. `$g_webservice_version_when_not_found`: This option specifies the default version to be used if the specified version is not found and `$g_webservice_error_when_version_not_found` is OFF. In this case, it's set to an empty string.
