The `detectBrowser` method is used to check whether the user's browser is supported by Pimcore. The method uses the `Browser` class from the Symfony BrowserKit component to detect the user's browser and its version. Then it checks if the browser meets the minimum requirements for Pimcore, which are:

* Firefox >= 72
* Chrome >= 84
* Safari >= 13.1
* Edge >= 90

If the user's browser is not supported, the method returns `false`, otherwise it returns `true`. The returned value is then used in the `indexAction` to display a warning message if the user's browser is not supported.
