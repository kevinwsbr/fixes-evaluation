**Deeplink Login Functionality**

The provided code snippet implements a deeplink login functionality in a Pimcore admin panel. The functionality allows users to be redirected to specific content or objects based on a deeplink token included in the query string.

**Deeplink Flow:**

* The `deeplinkAction()` method checks for the presence of a deeplink token in the query string.
* If a deeplink token is found, the method extracts the object type, ID, and language from the token.
* It then dispatches an event to redirect the user to the login page with the deeplink information.
* If the user is successfully logged in, they are redirected to the specified content or object based on the deeplink token.

**Deeplink View:**

* The `deeplink.html.twig` template displays a message indicating that the user needs to log in to access the content or object.
* It provides a link to the login page with the deeplink token included in the query string.

**Two-Factor Authentication:**

* The code also includes a two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanism.
* When a user tries to log in, they are prompted to enter a verification code sent to their registered email address or phone number.
* The `twoFactorAuthenticationAction()` method handles the 2FA process, displaying an error message if the verification code is incorrect.

**Browser Detection:**

* The code includes a `detectBrowser()` method that checks if the user's browser is supported by the application.
* Currently, the supported browsers are Firefox (72+), Chrome (84+), Safari (13.1+), and Edge (90+).

**Key Points:**

* Deeplink login provides a convenient way for users to access specific content or objects.
* 2FA enhances security by requiring an additional layer of verification for user authentication.
* Browser detection ensures compatibility with the supported browsers.

**Additional Notes:**

* The specific implementation of the deeplink token and the redirect process may vary depending on the application configuration.
* The code snippet does not include the entire application logic, only the relevant parts related to deeplink login and 2FA.
