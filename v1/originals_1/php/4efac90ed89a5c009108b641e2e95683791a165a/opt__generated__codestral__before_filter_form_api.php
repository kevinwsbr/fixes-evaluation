 This code defines a function `print_filter_box` and a class `FilterBoxGridLayout`. The function `print_filter_box` generates the HTML for a filter box, which is used to filter data. It takes in various parameters such as the filter object, show inputs, sort options, and page number. Inside the function, several table rows are created using instances of the `TableFieldsItem` class. The class `FilterBoxGridLayout` extends the `TableGridLayout` class and overrides some methods to customize the HTML output for the filter box.

Here's a brief description of each component:

1. **Function `print_filter_box`:**
   - Creates table rows with different fields such as sorting, show, filter id, match type, and highlight changed options.
   - Uses the `FilterBoxGridLayout` class to render the HTML table.

2. **Class `FilterBoxGridLayout`:**
   - Overrides methods for rendering table header (`render_td_item_header`) and content cells (`render_td_item_content`) with customized attributes such as class names, colspans, and IDs.
   - Also provides a method for rendering empty table header cells (`render_td_empty_header`).

In summary, the code defines a filter box that allows users to input filters for data, and it generates the HTML for this filter box using a customized layout class.
