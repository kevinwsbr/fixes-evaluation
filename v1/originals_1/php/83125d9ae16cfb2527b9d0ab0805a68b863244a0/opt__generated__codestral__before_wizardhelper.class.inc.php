 This code defines a class named `FieldUpdateHelper` which is used for updating fields in a form based on certain data. The class has various methods to retrieve and manipulate data related to the form and its fields, such as getting the target class, form prefix, initial state, stimulus, ID for a specific field, and whether or not to return non-editable fields.

   The `GetFields` method returns an array of field names that should be updated based on the data in the object. It iterates through attributes definitions and their relying classes to determine which fields need updating.

   The `GetTargetClass` method returns the target class name for the form.

   The `GetFormPrefix` method returns the prefix used for the form's elements.

   The `GetInitialState` method returns the initial state of the object if it exists; otherwise, it returns null.

   The `GetStimulus` method returns the stimulus value for the object if it exists; otherwise, it returns null.

   The `GetIdForField` method returns the ID for a specific field name if it exists in the form's fields map; otherwise, it returns an empty string.

   The `GetReturnNotEditableFields` method returns a boolean value indicating whether or not to return non-editable fields.

   The `GetJsForUpdateFields` method generates JavaScript code for updating the fields in the form based on the object's data. It creates a JSON representation of the object and assigns it to a JavaScript variable, then calls the `UpdateFields` method of that variable to update the fields in the form.

   Finally, the class has a static method named `ParseJsonSet` which is used for parsing a JSON set of objects and creating a CMDBObjectSet from them. The method iterates through each object in the set, sets its attributes based on the JSON data, and adds it to the CMDBObjectSet.
