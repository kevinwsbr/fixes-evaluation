 The provided PHP code defines a class named `Util` which contains several static methods. These methods are designed to generate random strings, convert binary data into readable ASCII characters, format dates with microseconds, and determine the maximum upload size based on server configuration settings. Below is a summary of each method's purpose:

1. **random_bytes($length, $raw = false)**: Generates a random string or raw bytes of specified length. It uses PHP 7's `random_bytes` function if available; otherwise, it falls back to OpenSSL's `openssl_random_pseudo_bytes`. The `$raw` parameter determines whether the output should be in binary form (`true`) or converted to ASCII characters (`false`).

2. **bin2ascii($input)**: Converts raw binary data into a readable string by encoding it using only alphanumeric characters (a-zA-Z0-9), which is useful for creating human-readable identifiers. This method mimics the behavior of a PHP internal function similar to `bin_to_readable` in its extension code.

3. **date_format($format = null)**: Formats the current date and time according to the specified format, including microseconds if the format string includes 'u'. It supports microseconds by parsing the system's microtime and timezone information directly into a `DateTime` object for formatting.

4. **max_upload_size()**: Retrieves the maximum upload size allowed by PHP configuration settings (`upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size`), returning the smaller of the two values to determine the practical limit for file uploads in bytes. This method uses `parse_bytes` to convert ini-get's string representations of byte sizes into integers.

These methods are useful for various tasks such as generating secure random data, managing date and time formats with precision, and configuring upload settings based on server capabilities. The class could be part of a larger application framework or used in utility scripts where these functionalities are required.
