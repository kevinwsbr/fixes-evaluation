This is a PHP file that contains functions for uploading and updating documents using the Compilatio service. The file includes several functions, each with its own purpose:

1. `compilatioUploadWorkDocument`: This function takes in two parameters - `docId` and `courseId`, both of which are integers representing the ID of a document and the course it belongs to, respectively. It uses the Compilatio API to upload the document to their service and returns a JSON object with information about the uploaded file.
2. `compilatioUpdateWorkDocument`: This function takes in two parameters - `docId` and `courseId`, both of which are integers representing the ID of a document and the course it belongs to, respectively. It uses the Compilatio API to update the document on their service with the latest version from the local file system.
3. `workDocExtension`: This function takes in two parameters - `docId` and `courseId`, both of which are integers representing the ID of a document and the course it belongs to, respectively. It retrieves the file extension of the document from the database and returns it as a string.
4. `getFileExtension`: This function takes in one parameter - `filename`, which is a string representing the name of a file. It retrieves the file extension of the file from its name and returns it as a string.
5. `getWorkTitle`: This function takes in two parameters - `docId` and `courseId`, both of which are integers representing the ID of a document and the course it belongs to, respectively. It retrieves the title of the document from the database and returns it as a string.
6. `getFilename`: This function takes in one parameter - `txt`, which is a string representing the name of a file. It extracts the filename from the full path of the file and returns it as a string.
7. `getWorkFolder`: This function takes in one parameter - `txt`, which is a string representing the full path of a file. It extracts the folder where the file is located and returns it as a string.
8. `getShortFilename`: This function takes in one parameter - `txt`, which is a string representing the name of a file. It extracts the filename from the full path of the file, truncates it to 10 characters if necessary, and returns it as a string.

These functions are used in various places throughout the codebase, such as in the uploading process of documents, where they use the `compilatioUploadWorkDocument` function to upload the document to Compilatio, or in the updating process, where they use the `compilatioUpdateWorkDocument` function to update the document on the service with the latest version from the local file system.
