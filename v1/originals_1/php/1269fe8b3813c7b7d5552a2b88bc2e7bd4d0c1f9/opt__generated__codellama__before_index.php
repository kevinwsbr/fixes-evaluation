The provided code has several security vulnerabilities:

1. Unvalidated Input: The code is using the `getParameter()` method to retrieve the value of the 'type' parameter, which can lead to a potential XSS attack if an attacker can control this input. It is important to validate any user-provided data before passing it to a template or executing it in any way.
2. Unfiltered Output: The code is using `echo` to output the error message, which can lead to a reflected XSS attack if the attacker can control the value of the 'type' parameter. It is important to filter any user-provided data before outputting it to prevent such attacks.
3. Use of SpoonHTTP: The code is using the `SpoonHTTP::setHeadersByCode()` method to set HTTP headers, which can be used to bypass security measures like Content Security Policy (CSP) or to execute malicious JavaScript code. It is important to use a secure and reliable mechanism for setting HTTP headers.
4. Use of SpoonFile: The code is using the `SpoonFile::getExtension()` method to extract the file extension from the 'querystring' parameter, which can lead to a potential directory traversal attack if an attacker can control this input. It is important to validate any user-provided data before passing it to a library or function that could potentially cause harm.

To fix these vulnerabilities, you should:

1. Validate the 'type' parameter using a secure method like `filter_var()` with FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING.
2. Use a secure output mechanism like `htmlspecialchars()` to filter any user-provided data before outputting it.
3. Use a reliable and secure mechanism for setting HTTP headers, such as `header()` instead of SpoonHTTP.
4. Validate the 'querystring' parameter using a secure method like `filter_var()` with FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING, and ensure that the file path is safe before passing it to any library or function.
