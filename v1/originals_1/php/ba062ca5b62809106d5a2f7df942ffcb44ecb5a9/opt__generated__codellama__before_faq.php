The code is vulnerable to several security issues:

1. SQL Injection: The code uses unfiltered user input in the query, which makes it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. A malicious user could inject malicious SQL code that could compromise the database or steal sensitive information. To fix this issue, the code should use prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.
2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The code uses unfiltered user input in the query, which makes it vulnerable to XSS attacks. A malicious user could inject malicious JavaScript code that could compromise the security of the site or steal sensitive information. To fix this issue, the code should filter user input using a whitelist of safe characters and escape any special characters.
3. Missing error handling: The code does not handle errors properly when querying the database. If an error occurs while executing a query, it will result in a fatal error that halts the script execution. To fix this issue, the code should handle errors properly by checking for error conditions and returning appropriate error messages to the user.
4. Insecure direct database query: The code uses direct queries to interact with the database, which is insecure and prone to SQL injection attacks. It should use a more secure approach such as using prepared statements or an ORM layer.
5. Insufficient input validation: The code does not validate user input properly before using it in the query. This can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues if malicious data is used in the query. To fix this issue, the code should validate user input properly by checking for validity and filtering out any invalid characters.
6. Insecure storage of sensitive information: The code stores sensitive information such as passwords in plaintext, which is a security risk. It should use a secure approach such as hashing or encrypting the data before storing it.
7. Lack of session management: The code does not properly manage sessions, which can lead to security issues if a user's session is lost or compromised. To fix this issue, the code should properly manage sessions using a session library or framework.
