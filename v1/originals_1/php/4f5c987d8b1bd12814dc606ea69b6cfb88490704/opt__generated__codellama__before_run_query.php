This code is for a PHP web application that allows users to run an OQL query on the Cube. The query syntax is checked and the results are displayed in a tabular format. If there is any error while running the query, it will be caught by the try-catch block and an error message will be displayed.

The code first initializes some variables, such as the OQL parser, the filter object, and the output page. It then checks if the query syntax is valid by trying to parse the expression using the `parse()` method of the parser. If there is no syntax error, the query is executed using the `run()` method of the parser. The results are then formatted as a table and displayed in the output page.

If there is any syntax error while running the query, it will be caught by the try-catch block and an error message will be displayed. Additionally, if the OQL expression contains any unknown words or invalid characters, the code will display a list of possible suggestions for the user to correct their query.

Overall, this code allows users to run and view the results of an OQL query on the Cube in a simple and straightforward way.
