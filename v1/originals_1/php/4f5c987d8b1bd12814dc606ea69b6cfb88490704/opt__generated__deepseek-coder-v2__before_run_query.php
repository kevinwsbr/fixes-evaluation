 The code you've provided appears to be part of a PHP script that processes and displays the results of a query based on user input. It handles various scenarios such as displaying query results, handling errors (like syntax errors), and managing form submissions for evaluation. Here’s a breakdown of what each section does:

1. **HTML Form Setup**:
   - The script starts by creating an HTML form which includes a text area where users can input their OQL (Object Query Language) queries. This is used to filter or query data from the system.
   - It also sets up a submit button for evaluation, linking this form to a backend process that will handle the submitted query.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - If there's an error in the syntax of the OQL query (e.g., a typo or unsupported command), it catches exceptions related to `OqlException` and displays detailed feedback about what went wrong, suggesting corrections if possible.
   - For other types of exceptions, it simply shows the error message without specific suggestions.

3. **Displaying Query Results**:
   - If the query is successful (i.e., there are results to display), it initializes a `DisplayBlock` object with the filter and configuration settings, then displays the results using this object's `Display()` method.
   - It constructs breadcrumb navigation elements that allow users to return to the original search setup or share the current query setup.

4. **Collapsible Section for More Info**:
   - For debugging purposes or when more detailed information about the query is needed, there’s a collapsible section where additional metadata such as the developed OQL query and serialized filter are shown. This can be expanded by users to inspect these details further.

5. **General Error Handling**:
   - The script includes general error handling for any exceptions that might occur during its execution (e.g., network errors, unexpected type of exception). It always outputs an error message on screen when such issues arise.

6. **Output the Page**:
   - Finally, regardless of whether results are displayed or there was an error, the script ensures to output the HTML content properly wrapped in a `<form>` tag using `DisplayBlock`'s `output()` method. This is crucial for rendering the page correctly when used as part of a larger application interface.

This script effectively manages user interactions with query systems, providing clear feedback and allowing users to correct errors or explore detailed information about their queries.
