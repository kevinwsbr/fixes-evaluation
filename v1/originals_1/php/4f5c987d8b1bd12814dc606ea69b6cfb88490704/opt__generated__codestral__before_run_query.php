 This code is a PHP script that handles user queries in an application. It performs the following tasks:

1. It includes necessary files and initializes variables such as `$sExpression`, `$eSyntaxError`, `$oFilter`, and `$sPageId`.
2. It attempts to create an instance of the `DBObjectSearch` class using the provided query expression, handling any potential exceptions that may occur during this process.
3. If successful, it creates a new instance of the `WebPage` class with appropriate parameters (title, breadcrumbs, and search options) based on the query results and user's input.
4. It then generates an HTML table containing the query results using the `DisplayResults()` function, applying pagination and sorting if necessary.
5. If any errors or exceptions occur during this process (such as a syntax error in the query), it displays appropriate error messages to the user.
6. Finally, it outputs the generated HTML content using the `output()` method of the `WebPage` class.
