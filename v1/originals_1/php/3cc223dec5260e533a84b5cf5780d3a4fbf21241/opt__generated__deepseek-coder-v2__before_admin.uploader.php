 The provided code snippet is a part of a PHP script that handles file uploads. It appears to be from an older version of a web application, possibly related to content management or administration tools, as indicated by the presence of `admin_uploader` in function and variable names. This script includes several checks and sanitization measures to ensure security when uploading files, particularly focusing on preventing unauthorized file types such as PHP scripts or HTML documents from being uploaded through other extensions like `.jpg`, `.gif`, etc.

Here's a breakdown of the key components and functionalities:

1. **File Extension Checking**: The script checks the extension of uploaded files to see if they are in a blacklist of forbidden file types (`$blacklist_extensions`). If an upload contains one of these blacklisted extensions, it is considered forbidden.

2. **MIME Type Check (for PHP and HTML)**: Starting from PHP 5.3, the script checks the MIME type of the uploaded file to detect if it might be a malicious attempt to bypass restrictions by uploading files with dangerous content through other allowed extensions. This includes checking for `text/x-php` or `text/html`.

3. **File Sanitization**: The filename is sanitized to remove any potentially harmful characters, ensuring that the file name adheres to naming conventions and avoids exploiting path traversal attacks.

4. **File Storage**: If a file passes all checks, it is moved from a temporary location (`$tmp_name`) to a designated directory (`$dir/$name`), with appropriate permissions set for security reasons.

5. **Session Handling**: The script adds successfully uploaded files to the session storage so that they can be referenced later in the application or displayed as part of an upload success message.

6. **Return Values**: The function returns `1` if all uploads are successful and valid, or `-1` if any errors occur during the upload process (e.g., file type is forbidden, MIME type check fails).

### Potential Issues and Improvements:

- **Security**: While the script includes some security measures, it might benefit from additional checks and possibly more modern practices for handling uploads in web applications today. This includes using standardized APIs for file handling (`move_uploaded_file`) and ensuring that all user inputs are validated properly to avoid vulnerabilities like SQL injection or path traversal attacks.
- **PHP Version Requirement**: The script requires PHP versions below 5.3, which is quite outdated now. Consider updating the codebase to ensure compatibility with modern PHP environments.
- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling and logging to provide more informative feedback in case of issues during upload or other errors that might not be handled currently.
- **Code Optimization**: The script can be optimized for readability, especially given its complexity related to file checks and sanitization processes. Consider refactoring for better maintainability.

### Usage Context:
This code snippet is likely part of a larger system where it's used within an admin panel or similar administrative interface to handle uploads securely. It assumes that the server environment allows these PHP functions to execute safely, which might be a concern in shared hosting environments with restricted PHP configurations.
