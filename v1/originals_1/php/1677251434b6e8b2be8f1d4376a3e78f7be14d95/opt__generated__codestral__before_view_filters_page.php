 This code is a PHP script that generates an HTML form for filtering data. It's used in a web application, likely a project management or issue tracking system. The form includes hidden inputs for the type and view type of the filter, as well as a search input field. Depending on the value of `$f_for_screen` and `$f_static`, additional hidden inputs may be added to the form.

The form is generated within a Bootstrap widget box with a blue header that contains a dropdown menu for toggling the view type of the filter. The main body of the widget box contains the filter inputs, which are generated dynamically by calling `filter_form_draw_inputs()`. Below the inputs, there's a toolbar with a search input field and a "Use Query" button.

The form is enclosed within a `<div>` element with an ID of "filters", and it has an action attribute that points to the current page ("view_page.php"). The method attribute is set to "post".
