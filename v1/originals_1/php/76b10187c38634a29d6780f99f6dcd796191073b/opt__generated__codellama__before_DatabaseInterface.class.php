This file contains the class `PMA\libraries\DatabaseInterface`, which is used to abstract away the details of a specific database management system (DBMS) from PhpMyAdmin. The class provides methods for executing queries, fetching results, and performing other operations on the database.

The constructor of the class takes an array of parameters as input, which includes information about the database connection. The `getConnection()` method returns a database link that can be used to execute queries on the database. The `isAmazonRds()` method checks if this database server is running on Amazon RDS.

The `fetchAssoc()`, `fetchRow()`, and `fetchArray()` methods return an array of rows from the result set, where each row is represented as a numerically indexed array or an associative array based on the `$assoc` parameter. The `fieldName()` method returns the name of a field in the specified column of the result set, while the `fieldFlags()` method returns a string representation of the flags for that field.

The `getServerPort()`, `getServerSocket()`, and `getLink()` methods are used to retrieve information about the server connection, such as the port number or socket path, and a link object that can be used to execute queries on the database. The `getKillQuery()` method returns the SQL query for killing a process based on the specified process ID.

Finally, the class provides methods for getting the phpmyadmin database manager and a table with database name and table name.
