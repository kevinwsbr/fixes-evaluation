 This JavaScript code snippet is designed to handle various functionalities related to sharing links in a web application, possibly part of a file-sharing or collaboration tool. The script uses jQuery for DOM manipulation and AJAX requests, and it interacts with the backend via OCS (OData Collaboration System) API endpoints. Below is a breakdown of its main components:

### 1. Initialization and Event Binding
The code starts by waiting for the document to be fully loaded before attaching event listeners. It listens for changes on an expiration date field within a specific dropdown, submits form data via AJAX when necessary (comments indicate that emailing links is not supported in this context), and handles various actions like showing or hiding tooltips based on success or failure of AJAX requests.

### 2. Handling Change Event on Expiration Date Field
When the expiration date field changes:
- The tooltip is hidden if it was shown previously.
- The 'error' class is removed from the field to reset any visual errors.
- An AJAX request is sent to update the share with the new expiration date using an OCS API endpoint.
- If the request fails, a tooltip with an error message is displayed next to the field.

### 3. Not Supported Features (Comments)
The script includes sections that are commented out:
- **Emailing Links**: The email functionality is not supported in this context as indicated by comments and commented code. This section would typically handle sending a share link via email, but it's currently disabled or unsupported.
- **Mail Notification Checkbox Handling**: Another feature related to informing recipients about the shared link is also marked as not supported and similarly includes commented out code for handling its logic.

### 4. General Comments on Code Quality
The script has several `FIXME` comments, which suggest that there are known issues or missing features in the current implementation:
- **Emailing Links**: The comment "FIXME Emailing links is not supported in Gallery" indicates a limitation of the feature.
- **Mail Notification Handling**: Similarly, another FIXME suggests that handling checkboxes for mail notifications is not implemented.

### 5. AJAX Setup and Error Handling
The script sets up an AJAX request to send data to the server using POST or PUT methods based on the context (update share with new expiration date). It handles success and error cases by showing or updating tooltips, adding a 'error' class, or displaying alert messages for user feedback.

### 6. jQuery Document Ready Functionality
The script is wrapped inside a `$(document).ready(function() { ... });` function to ensure all DOM elements are loaded before any jQuery code runs. This setup helps in managing dependencies and ensuring that the script only executes when the page is ready.

This JavaScript snippet demonstrates how to manage asynchronous interactions with backend services, handle form data submission, and provide visual feedback to users based on AJAX responses. It also highlights areas where additional features might be needed or where certain functionalities are not supported.
