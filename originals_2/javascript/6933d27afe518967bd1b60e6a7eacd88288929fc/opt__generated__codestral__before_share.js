 This JavaScript code is using the jQuery library to handle events and make AJAX requests. It appears to be part of a larger system, possibly a file sharing application. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. When the document is ready, it adds an event listener for when a user clicks on elements with ID `dropdown` that have a child element with the name attribute set to 'mailNotification'. This function sends a POST request to the server to inform or disable mail notifications for share recipients.

2. It also has a commented out section that appears to handle emailing links, but it's currently disabled. If this feature was enabled, when a user submits the form with ID `dropdown #emailPrivateLink`, it would prevent the default form submission behavior, gather necessary data (like link, item type, item source, email, and expiration date), and send a POST request to the server to email the link.

3. When a user changes the value of an input element with ID `expirationDate` inside an element with ID `dropdown`, it sends a PUT request to the server to update the expiration date for a share. If this request fails, it displays an error message in a tooltip on the expiration date field.

4. The code also includes functions to handle resharing and deleting shares. However, these functions are not defined in the provided code snippet.
