 Here are the main functions in your code snippet:

1. `handleSingleWhereItem`: This function handles a single where item and formats it as a string that can be used in a SQL query. It takes three parameters - key, value, and options. The key is the column name, the value is the value to filter on, and the options are additional settings for the query.

   If `value` is an instance of Sequelize.Utils.literal, it will just return its string representation. If not, it will check if any type conversion is needed based on the data type of the column (if available). It will then escape the value to prevent SQL injection and return a formatted string that can be used in a WHERE clause.

2. `whereItemsQuery`: This function takes an object or array of where items and options, and returns a formatted string that can be used in a SQL query's WHERE clause. If the input is an object, it will convert each key-value pair into a single where item using `handleSingleWhereItem`. If the input is an array, it will join all the where items with 'AND'.

3. `getWhereConditions`: This function takes various types of input and returns a formatted string that can be used in a SQL query's WHERE clause. It handles Sequelize methods, objects, numbers, strings, buffers, arrays, and null values. For objects and numbers, it uses `whereItemsQuery` to convert them into where items. For strings and arrays, it formats them directly. For buffers, it escapes the buffer and returns its string representation. For null values, it returns '1=1'.

4. `booleanValue`: This function is a simple pass-through function that returns its input value as is. It seems to be unused in your code snippet.
