 This script manages GNOME Shell extensions, which are user-created plugins that can customize and extend the functionality of a GNOME desktop environment. The code handles enabling, disabling, loading, reloading, and managing all installed extensions.

   Here's how it works:

   1. The `init` function is called at startup to initialize the session mode. It connects the 'updated' signal of Main.sessionMode to _sessionUpdated, which checks if extensions are allowed by the current session mode and updates their state accordingly.

   2. The `_loadExtensions` function sets up the necessary settings changes handlers (for enabled-extensions, disable-user-extensions, and extension-disable-version-check) and calls the scanExtensions method of ExtensionUtils.ExtensionFinder to discover installed extensions. When an extension is found, it's passed to loadExtension for further processing.

   3. The `loadExtension` function installs the importer for the given extension and imports its module. If there's an initialization function in this module, it calls it and stores the returned value as extensionState. This state object is then assigned to extension.stateObj. The final step in loadExtension is setting the extension's state to DISABLED and emitting the 'extension-loaded' signal with the UUID of the extension.

   4. The `getEnabledExtensions` function retrieves a list of enabled extensions from either Main.sessionMode.enabledExtensions or global.settings, depending on whether it's an array or not. If user extensions are disabled in settings, this function will return an empty list.

   5. The `onEnabledExtensionsChanged` function is called when the 'enabled-extensions' setting changes. It compares the new and old lists of enabled extensions to find out which ones were added (to be enabled) or removed (to be disabled). It then calls enableExtension/disableExtension for these UUIDs accordingly.

   6. The `_onVersionValidationChanged` function is called when the 'extension-disable-version-check' setting changes. It reloads all extensions and enables them if allowed by the sessionMode.

   7. The `enableAllExtensions` and `disableAllExtensions` functions handle enabling or disabling all currently enabled extensions. They check if extensions are already in an appropriate state before proceeding to avoid unnecessary operations.

   8. The `_sessionUpdated` function ensures that the extension manager's state is synchronized with the session mode. If extensions are allowed by the current session mode, it enables them; otherwise, disables them.
