 The provided code snippet is part of a class named `ByteArray` located in the `sfntly` namespace. This class likely represents a dynamically resizable byte array, similar to Java's `byte[]`. The class contains methods for copying data from and to other sources (like streams or arrays), as well as constructors for initializing the object.

Here's an overview of what each method does:

1. **Constructor Methods**:
   - `ByteArray(int32_t filled_length, int32_t storage_length = 0, bool growable = false)`: Initializes a new ByteArray instance with a specified filled length and optional storage length (defaulting to zero). The `growable` parameter determines whether the array can expand dynamically.
   - `Init(int32_t filled_length, int32_t storage_length, bool growable)`: A helper method used by constructors to initialize the ByteArray instance.

2. **Copying Methods**:
   - `int32_t CopyTo(OutputStream* os)`, `int32_t CopyTo(OutputStream* os, int32_t offset, int32_t length)`: These methods copy data from the ByteArray to an OutputStream. The second version allows specifying a starting offset and length of data to be copied.
   - `bool CopyFrom(InputStream* is, int32_t length)`, `bool CopyFrom(InputStream* is)`: These methods read data from an InputStream into the ByteArray. If the ByteArray's capacity is not sufficient for the operation, it will attempt to grow itself dynamically (if enabled).
   - `int32_t CopyFromByteArray(const ByteVector& array, int32_t dst_offset, int32_t length)`: This method copies data from a provided ByteVector into the ByteArray at a specified destination offset. It is similar to the standard copy operation but operates on instances of ByteVector (presumably defined elsewhere in the same library).

3. **Get and Put Methods**:
   - `int Get(int32_t index, void* dst, int32_t dst_offset = 0, int32_t length = -1)`: Reads data from the ByteArray at a specified index into a provided destination buffer. The size of the data read is determined by the `length` parameter (defaulting to all available data).
   - `int Put(int32_t index, const void* src, int32_t src_offset = 0, int32_t length = -1)`: Writes data from a provided source buffer into the ByteArray at a specified index. The size of the data written is determined by the `length` parameter (defaulting to all available data).

4. **Utility Methods**:
   - Various methods for setting and getting properties like `Size()`, `Length()`, `SetFilledLength(int32_t filled_length)`, etc., which manage internal state related to the size of the array or its current content length.

5. **Destructor**:
   - The destructor is implicitly defined by the class definition, and it does not perform any special operations beyond what might be inherited from a base class (if there were one).

The provided code snippet includes several methods that are marked as `inline`, which suggests these functions should be optimized for small size or simplicity in terms of implementation. However, the actual optimizations would depend on how they are used within the application and their performance characteristics.
