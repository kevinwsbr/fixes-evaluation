 It seems like you've shared a segment of C++ code from the sfntly library. This segment of code appears to handle data operations on a ByteArray class, which is likely designed to work with bytes or binary data. Here's a breakdown of what each function does:

1. `ByteArray::CopyTo(OutputStream* os)` and `ByteArray::CopyTo(OutputStream* os, int32_t offset, int32_t length)`: These functions are used to copy the content of the ByteArray to an OutputStream. The second function allows for specifying a starting point (offset) and a length to copy.

2. `ByteArray::CopyFrom(InputStream* is, int32_t length)` and `ByteArray::CopyFrom(InputStream* is)`: These functions are used to copy data from an InputStream into the ByteArray. The second function continues reading until there's no more data in the input stream.

3. `ByteArray::ByteArray(int32_t filled_length, int32_t storage_length, bool growable)` and `ByteArray::ByteArray(int32_t filled_length, int32_t storage_length)`: These are constructors for the ByteArray class. They initialize a new instance of the ByteArray with a specified amount of filled data and storage capacity.

4. `void ByteArray::Init(int32_t filled_length, int32_t storage_length, bool growable)`: This is an initialization function that sets up the ByteArray's properties after it has been constructed.
