  This code defines several kernel builders for the `QuantizeAndDequantize` operation. A kernel builder is a class that registers a kernel with TensorFlow. The kernel builder is responsible for defining the device and type constraints of the kernel, as well as the actual implementation of the kernel.

In this case, the code defines two kernels: one for CPU devices and another for GPU devices. Each kernel builder specifies the type constraint `T` for the operation, which means that the kernel can only be used with float or double types.

The `REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER` macro is a convenience wrapper around the `RegisterKernel` function. It takes in several arguments:

* `Name`: The name of the kernel.
* `Device`: The device where the kernel will be executed (either CPU or GPU).
* `TypeConstraint<T>("T")`: The type constraint for the operation.

For example, the first kernel builder defines a kernel with the name `QuantizeAndDequantizeV2`, that can only be used on CPU devices and takes a float or double input tensor. The second kernel builder defines a kernel with the same name but for GPU devices.

The `REGISTER_KERNEL_BUILDER` macro is used to register each kernel with TensorFlow, so that it can be executed during inference.
