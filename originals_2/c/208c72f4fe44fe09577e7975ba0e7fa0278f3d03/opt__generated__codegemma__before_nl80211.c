**Module Name:** nl80211

**Purpose:**

The nl80211 module provides a mechanism for inter-process communication (IPC) between the kernel and user-space applications related to the IEEE 802.11 wireless protocol. It enables communication between the kernel's wireless networking subsystem and user-space applications via a netlink socket.

**Key Functions:**

- **Socket Creation:** The module creates netlink sockets for various operations, such as configuration, scan, regulatory information, and MLME (Medium Access Control).
- **Event Notifications:** It provides support for event notifications, such as new clients connecting, disconnections, and link quality changes.
- **Command Handling:** It handles user-space commands via netlink messages, allowing users to configure wireless devices, query their status, and control various aspects of the wireless network.
- **MLME Message Handling:** It receives MLME messages from the kernel and forwards them to user-space applications via the netlink socket.

**Key Features:**

- **Multicast Communication:** The module uses multicast groups to broadcast messages to multiple users.
- **Secure Communication:** It uses cryptographic mechanisms to ensure secure communication between the kernel and user-space applications.
- **Non-Blocking API:** It provides a non-blocking API for handling netlink events and messages.
- **Support for Different Wireless Protocols:** It supports various IEEE 802.11 wireless protocols.

**Implementation:**

The module is implemented as a kernel module and uses the Linux netlink framework. It includes the following components:

- **Genl Family:** A netlink family used for communication.
- **Netlink Notifier:** A notifier used for handling netlink events.
- **MC Groups:** Multicast groups for different message types.
- **Socket Operations:** Functions for creating and handling netlink sockets.

**Usage:**

Users can use user-space applications or tools to interact with the nl80211 module via netlink sockets. These applications can perform various operations, such as configuring wireless devices, monitoring network status, and sending MLME messages.

**Additional Notes:**

- The module supports both IPv4 and IPv6.
- It is recommended to use the `nl80211tool` utility for interacting with the nl80211 module.
- The module is part of the Linux kernel and is included in the `wireless` kernel configuration.
