 The provided code snippet is part of a library for handling image processing in a programming environment, likely related to the ImageMagick library. This particular section deals with registering and unregistering support for the DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) image format within this library. Let's break down what each function does:

### Function: `RegisterDCMImage()`
- **Purpose**: Registers the DICOM image format by adding relevant attributes to the list of supported formats. This includes specifying the image format tag, a method for reading and/or writing the format, whether it supports saving multiple frames in one file or blob, native in-memory I/O capabilities, and a brief description of the format.
- **Details**:
  - It first defines a static note about DICOM which is used to provide information about what DICOM is and its relevance in medical imaging contexts.
  - Then it creates an entry for the DICOM image format using `AcquireMagickInfo()` which initializes a `MagickInfo` structure with the relevant details.
  - It sets the decoder method to `ReadDCMImage` (presumably for reading images), and the magic check function (`IsDCM`) to identify if an image is in DICOM format.
  - Additional flags are set up, such as turning off a specific coder adjoint flag and enabling support for seekable streams which might be useful for handling multi-frame DICOM images where seeking through frames would be required.
  - The note about DICOM is assigned to the `note` field of the `MagickInfo` entry.
  - Finally, it registers this information with the library by calling `RegisterMagickInfo()`.
- **Return**: Returns a unique signature indicating that the registration was successful, which in this case matches `MagickImageCoderSignature`.

### Function: `UnregisterDCMImage()`
- **Purpose**: Removes the format registrations for DICOM images from the list of supported formats. This effectively unregisters the DICOM image format, making it unavailable for future operations unless re-registered.
- **Details**: Uses `UnregisterMagickInfo()` to remove the registration entry for "DCM" which was previously registered by `RegisterDCMImage()`.
- **Usage**: Typically called when you want to disable support for DICOM images in your application or library that uses ImageMagick, perhaps during specific operations where it's not needed.

These functions are crucial for module management within the ImageMagick framework, allowing dynamic addition and removal of image formats as per requirements or configurations. They ensure flexibility and modularity by encapsulating format-specific behavior within their respective modules.
