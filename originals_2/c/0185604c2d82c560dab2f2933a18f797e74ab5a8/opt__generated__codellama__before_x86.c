  This code defines several tracepoint-related functions that are used for tracing KVM's interaction with the guest OS and other kernel components. Here is a brief explanation of each function:
  
  * `kvm_exit`: This function is called when the KVM virtual machine exits to user space, and it traces information about the exit reason.
  * `kvm_fast_mmio`: This function is called when a guest accesses an IO port or memory-mapped device that is not supported by KVM's I/O remapping facility, and it traces information about the accessed address.
  * `kvm_inj_virq`: This function is called when a virtual interrupt is injected into a guest, and it traces information about the injected interrupt.
  * `kvm_page_fault`: This function is called when a page fault occurs inside the guest, and it traces information about the faulting address.
  * `kvm_msr`: This function is called when a MSR (model-specific register) access occurs inside the guest, and it traces information about the accessed MSR.
  * `kvm_cr`: This function is called when a control register access occurs inside the guest, and it traces information about the accessed control register.
  * `kvm_nested_vmrun`: This function is called when KVM's nested virtualization feature is used, and it traces information about the VM run operation.
  * `kvm_nested_vmexit`: This function is called when a guest VM exits to user space due to a nested VM exit, and it traces information about the exit reason.
  * `kvm_nested_intr_vmexit`: This function is called when a guest VM exits to user space due to an interrupt being delivered to the guest, and it traces information about the delivered interrupt.
  * `kvm_invlpga`: This function is called when a INVLPGA instruction is executed inside the guest, and it traces information about the page to be invalidated.
  * `kvm_skinit`: This function is called when a SKINIT instruction is executed inside the guest, and it traces information about the target system.
  * `kvm_nested_intercepts`: This function is called when a nested VM exit occurs due to an intercepted event, and it traces information about the intercepted event.
  * `kvm_write_tsc_offset`: This function is called when a TSC offset write operation is performed inside the guest, and it traces information about the written offset.
  * `kvm_ple_window`: This function is called when a PLE window overflow occurs inside the guest, and it traces information about the overflow event.
  * `kvm_pml_full`: This function is called when the Page Map Level (PML) table is full, and it traces information about the full PML table.
  * `kvm_pi_irte_update`: This function is called when a guest's interrupt remapping entry is updated, and it traces information about the updated IRTE (Interrupt Remapping Table Entry).
