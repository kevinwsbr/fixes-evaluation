This code should be added to the `module.c` file, which is used for registering and unregistering image formats in ImageMagick. It adds support for reading and writing XCF images using the `ReadXCFImage()` and `WriteXCFImage()` functions, respectively. The functions are declared as prototypes at the top of the file, and their implementations are added below the prototype declarations.

Note that this is just an example code snippet, you may need to adjust it for your specific use case. Also, please note that the `RegisterMagickInfo()` function is used to register the image format, but it's deprecated in ImageMagick 7 and later versions. You can use the `RegisterImageFormat()` function instead.
