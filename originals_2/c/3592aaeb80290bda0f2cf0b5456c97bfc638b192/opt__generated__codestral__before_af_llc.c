 This code is a kernel module for the Linux operating system, written in C. It implements the IEEE 802.2 protocol family for Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer of the Data Link Layer in the OSI model for network communication. The code includes functions for socket creation, binding, connecting, listening, and accepting connections, as well as sending and receiving messages over LLC sockets. It also initializes and registers various protocol handlers, creates proc_fs entries for configuration, sets up sysctl parameters, and registers the new PF_LLC network family.
