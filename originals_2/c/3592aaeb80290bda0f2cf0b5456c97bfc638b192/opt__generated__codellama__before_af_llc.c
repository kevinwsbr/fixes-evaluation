  This is a kernel module written in C for the Linux operating system. The code defines a new network protocol family called LLC (Logical Link Control) and registers it with the kernel using the `sock_register()` function. It also defines a set of procedures that are associated with this protocol family, such as socket creation, binding, and closing.

The module is initialized and exited using the `module_init()` and `module_exit()` functions respectively, which register and unregister the LLC protocol family with the kernel. The module also defines a set of sysctl entries for controlling the behavior of the LLC protocol and a set of procfs entries for debugging purposes.

The module is licensed under the GPL (General Public License) and is authored by Procom 1997, Jay Schullist 2001, and Arnaldo C. Melo 2001-2003. It provides support for IEEE 802.2 PF_LLC networks.
