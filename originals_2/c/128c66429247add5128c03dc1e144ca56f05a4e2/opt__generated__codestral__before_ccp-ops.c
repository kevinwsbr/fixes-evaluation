 This code is a part of a larger cryptography library and it seems to handle commands for different encryption engines such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), DES3 (Triple Data Encryption Standard), SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm), RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography). The function `ccp_run_cmd` is the main entry point for executing cryptographic commands, which first checks the command's engine type and then calls the appropriate handler.

   Here are some insights about the different handlers:

- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): There are separate handlers for AES commands with modes like CMAC (Cipher-based Message Authentication Code) and GCM (Galois/Counter Mode). The function `ccp_run_aes_cmd` is the default handler for other AES modes.

- XTS-AES: The `ccp_run_xts_aes_cmd` function handles commands for the XTS-AES (XEX-based Tweakable Encryption Scheme) encryption engine.

- DES3 (Triple Data Encryption Standard): The `ccp_run_des3_cmd` function handles commands for the DES3 encryption engine.

- SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm): The `ccp_run_sha_cmd` function handles commands for the SHA cryptographic hash algorithm engine.

- RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman): The `ccp_run_rsa_cmd` function handles commands for the RSA encryption engine.

- PASSTHRU: The `ccp_run_passthru_cmd` and `ccp_run_passthru_nomap_cmd` functions handle commands for the PASSTHRU engine, which is likely used for passing data through without encryption or decryption.

- ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography): The `ccp_run_ecc_cmd` function handles commands for the ECC engine. It checks the command's function type and then calls the appropriate handler based on that. There are separate handlers for ECC functions like MMUL, MADD, MINV, PADD, PMUL, and PDBL.
