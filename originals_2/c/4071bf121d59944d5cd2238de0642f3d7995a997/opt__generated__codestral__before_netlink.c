 This is a piece of code that sets up the Netlink Generic (GENL) interface for NFC (Near Field Communication) operations. The provided functions and structures are used to create, manage, and tear down the GENL family which will handle communication between userspace applications and the kernel-space NFC driver.

   Here's a breakdown of the main components:

1. `nfc_genl_family` is the structure that defines the Netlink GENL family for NFC operations. It includes metadata about the family, such as its name, version, and the maximum number of attributes it can handle.

2. `nfc_genl_policy` is an array defining the Netlink operations and their access permissions.

3. `nfc_genl_ops` is an array containing function pointers to GENL operations that can be performed by userspace applications, such as getting a device list or transmitting data.

4. `nfc_genl_mcgrps` defines the Netlink multicast groups available for NFC notifications.

5. The `nfc_urelease_event_work` function is used to handle the `NETLINK_URELEASE` event, which occurs when a userspace application disconnects from the NETLINK socket. In this case, it stops any ongoing polling operations associated with the port ID that was released.

6. The `nfc_genl_rcv_nl_event` function is used to register for notifications about Netlink events, such as when a userspace application disconnects from the socket. It allocates and schedules a work item to handle the event asynchronously.

7. The `nfc_genl_data_init` and `nfc_genl_data_exit` functions are used to initialize and clean up the GENL data for each NFC device, including mutexes and other required resources.

8. Finally, `nfc_genl_init` registers the Netlink GENL family and initializes notifications, while `nfc_genl_exit` unregisters the family and cleans up any remaining resources when the module is removed from the kernel.
