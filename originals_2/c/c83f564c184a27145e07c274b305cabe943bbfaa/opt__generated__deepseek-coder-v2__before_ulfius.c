 The provided code snippet is a part of a larger library, likely related to URL encoding and decoding, as well as some initialization functions for the library. Let's break down each function and its purpose in detail:

1. **ulfius_url_encode**:
   - **Purpose**: This function encodes a given string into a URL-encoded format.
   - **Implementation**: It iterates over each character of the input string, encoding it if necessary (e.g., converting spaces to `+` and non-alphanumeric characters to their hexadecimal representation).
   - **Return Value**: A pointer to the newly allocated encoded string. The caller is responsible for freeing this memory.

2. **ulfius_url_decode**:
   - **Purpose**: This function decodes a URL-encoded string back to its original form.
   - **Implementation**: It iterates over each character of the input string, decoding it if necessary (e.g., converting `+` back to space and hexadecimal characters to their corresponding ASCII values).
   - **Return Value**: A pointer to the newly allocated decoded string. The caller is responsible for freeing this memory.

3. **ulfius_global_init**:
   - **Purpose**: This function initializes global resources used by the library, including CURL and Jansson (if not disabled).
   - **Implementation**: It sets up CURL with appropriate settings and allocators if curl is enabled. It also configures Jansson to use the provided memory allocation functions.
   - **Return Value**: An integer representing the result of the initialization (`U_OK` on success, other error codes on failure).

4. **ulfius_global_close**:
   - **Purpose**: This function cleans up global resources used by the library when it is no longer needed.
   - **Implementation**: It shuts down CURL if it was initialized.
   - **Details**: Since this is a cleanup function, there's no return value; it simply performs the necessary clean-up tasks.

### Key Points:
- **Memory Management**: The library uses standard memory management functions (`malloc`, `realloc`, and `free`) which can be overridden by the application if needed (via `o_get_alloc_funcs`).
- **Error Handling**: Errors are logged using a function pointer (`y_log_message`), allowing for custom error handling mechanisms.
- **Dependencies**: The library interacts with CURL for network operations and Jansson for JSON processing, but these can be disabled by preprocessor directives if not needed.

### Usage Notes:
- Ensure that the memory allocated by `malloc` is properly freed after use to avoid memory leaks.
- Handle possible errors in a robust manner, as shown with logging error messages using `y_log_message`.

This code snippet provides essential building blocks for handling URLs and global initialization tasks within an application or library context where network operations and JSON processing might be required.
