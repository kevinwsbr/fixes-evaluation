 This is a Linux kernel module implementing the Firmware Framework for SuperSpeed USB (FFS). The module defines a new USB function type called "ffs" and provides various functions to manage this type.

Here's a brief explanation of some key parts of the code:

- `struct ffs_dev` represents a FFS device, with members such as its name, mounted status, reference count, options, ready and closed callbacks, and data associated with it.
- The `ffs_alloc_inst` function is called when a new instance of the FFS function type is created. It allocates memory for a new `struct ffs_dev` and initializes its members.
- The `ffs_release_dev` function is called when an instance of the FFS function type is released. It updates the mounted status of the device, calls any registered release callback, and releases the device's resources.
- The `ffs_ready` function is called when a client is ready to use the FFS device. It checks if the device is valid and not already in use, marks it as ready, and calls any registered ready callback.
- The `ffs_closed` function is called when a client finishes using the FFS device. It updates the mounted status of the device, calls any registered closed callback, and releases the device's resources if necessary.
- The `ffs_mutex_lock` function is a helper function to lock a mutex in either blocking or nonblocking mode.
- The `ffs_prepare_buffer` function is a helper function to allocate memory for a buffer and copy data from user space into it. It's used to handle input buffers passed by userspace applications.
