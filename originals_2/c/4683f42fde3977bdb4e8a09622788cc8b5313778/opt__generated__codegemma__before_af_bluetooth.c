**Module Initialization and Cleanup Functions**

The code snippet you provided contains functions for initializing and cleaning up the Bluetooth Core module.

**bt_procfs_init()**

* Creates a new entry in the /proc/net directory with the specified name.
* Sets the file operations for the new entry to handle Bluetooth socket operations.
* Associates the given `bt_sock_list` with the entry.
* Returns 0 on success, or an error code on failure.

**bt_procfs_cleanup()**

* Removes the entry from the /proc/net directory with the specified name.

**Module Initialization**

* Initializes the Bluetooth Core module.
* Creates a new Bluetooth socket family.
* Initializes the HCI device and connection manager.
* Initializes the L2CAP, SCO, and other Bluetooth protocols.

**Module Cleanup**

* Cleans up the Bluetooth protocols.
* Unregisters the Bluetooth socket family.
* Removes the /proc/net entry.

**Module Features**

* Provides access to Bluetooth socket information through the /proc/net directory.
* Enables communication with Bluetooth devices using the L2CAP, SCO, and other protocols.

**Additional Notes**

* The code uses the seq_ops framework to provide a sequence of Bluetooth socket information.
* The `custom_seq_show()` function can be used to customize the output of the sequence.
* The module is licensed under the GPL.

**Conclusion**

The code snippet provides a comprehensive solution for initializing and managing the Bluetooth Core module. It enables access to Bluetooth socket information and facilitates communication with Bluetooth devices.
