 The code you've provided is a module for the Linux Kernel that implements various cryptographic algorithms, specifically Counter with CBC MAC (CCM), RFC 4309, and Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code (CBC-MAC). Here's an explanation of each part:

1. **cbcmac_create**: This function creates a new instance for the CBC-MAC algorithm. It allocates memory for the instance, initializes it with the given cryptographic algorithm, and registers it. If any error occurs during this process, it cleans up and returns the error.

2. **crypto_cbcmac_tmpl**: This is a template structure that defines the name, creation function, freeing function, and module for the CBC-MAC algorithm.

3. **ccm_create**: Similar to `cbcmac_create`, this function creates a new instance for the CCM and RFC 4309 algorithms. It allocates memory for the instance, initializes it with the given cryptographic algorithm, sets up the necessary functions for the transformation context (tfm), and registers the instance. If any error occurs during this process, it cleans up and returns the error.

4. **crypto_ccm_base_tmpl**, **crypto_rfc4309_tmpl**, and **crypto_ccm_tmpl**: These are template structures that define the name, creation function, freeing function, and module for the CCM base, RFC 4309, and CCM algorithms, respectively.

5. **crypto_ccm_module_init** and **crypto_ccm_module_exit**: These functions are called when the module is loaded into or unloaded from the kernel. They register and unregister the templates for the cryptographic algorithms. If any error occurs during registration, it undoes previous registrations to leave the system in a consistent state.

In summary, this code defines and registers several cryptographic algorithm instances that can be used by other parts of the Linux Kernel or user space applications. It ensures proper initialization, memory management, and cleanup of resources.
