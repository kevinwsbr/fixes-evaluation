 The code snippet you've provided is a part of an implementation for handling image encoding in a software project. Specifically, it deals with writing images in the PNG format and potentially in MNG (Multiple-image Network Graphics) format if supported by the library version. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of what this code does:

### Code Structure and Purpose
The code is structured to handle different scenarios based on whether the installed libpng library meets certain requirements or not. The main functions are `WritePNGImage` and `WriteMNGImage`, which encapsulate the logic for writing PNG and MNG images, respectively. If the libpng version does not meet the required standard (version 1.5.0), it outputs an error message and terminates with a thrown exception.

### Key Functions Explained

#### `WritePNGImage` Function
- **Purpose**: This function is intended to handle PNG image encoding, but due to conditions (checked at runtime or compile time, depending on the context), it might not execute as expected if the libpng version does not support certain features required for handling MNG images.
- **Parameters**: Takes `ImageInfo` and `Image` pointers as parameters.
- **Logic**: If the conditions are met for handling PNG and MNG formats (typically checked against a minimum libpng version), it proceeds to encode the image in PNG format, possibly with additional steps for MNG if supported.
- **Error Handling**: If the libpng version is too old, it logs an error message and throws an exception.

#### `WriteMNGImage` Function
- **Purpose**: This function also handles image encoding but specifically targets the MNG format if possible. It acts as a wrapper or fallback for `WritePNGImage` when direct support for MNG might not be available in the current libpng version.
- **Parameters**: Similar to `WritePNGImage`, it takes `ImageInfo` and `Image` pointers.
- **Logic**: Calls `WritePNGImage` with the provided parameters, serving as a compatibility layer if direct MNG handling is not supported by the libpng version.

### Code Flow Summary
1. **Version Check**: The code starts by checking the libpng version at runtime to ensure it supports the necessary features for handling PNG and MNG formats.
2. **Function Selection**: Depending on whether the required libpng version is met, either `WritePNGImage` or a placeholder function (`printf`-based error message) is called.
3. **Error Handling**: If the libpng version does not meet the requirements, an error message is logged and an exception is thrown.
4. **Resource Management**: The code handles resource management by freeing allocated structures when operations are completed or terminated early due to errors.

### Usage Context
This code snippet is likely part of a larger software project where handling multiple image formats (like PNG and MNG) dynamically based on library capabilities is important. It ensures that the application can adapt to different environments and configurations, providing robust error handling for unsupported configurations.
