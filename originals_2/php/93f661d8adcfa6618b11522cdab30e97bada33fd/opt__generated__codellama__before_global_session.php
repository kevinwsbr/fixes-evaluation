The code includes several security vulnerabilities:

1. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability in the `showHideFilter` variable, which can be exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript code in the filter settings page.
2. XSS vulnerability in the `clearFilterTitle` variable, which can also be exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript code in the filter settings page.
3. Insecure use of `basename()` function: The `basename()` function is used to get the name of a file from a given path. However, it does not validate the input and can lead to directory traversal attacks if an attacker can control the input.
4. Insecure use of `read_config_option()`: The `read_config_option()` function is used to read configuration options from the cacti.ini file. However, it does not validate the input and can lead to RCE (Remote Code Execution) attacks if an attacker can control the configuration option name or value.
5. Insecure use of `isset()`: The `isset()` function is used to check if a variable is set and is not NULL. However, it does not validate the input and can lead to information leakage if an attacker can control the variable name.
6. Insecure use of `get_nfilter_request_var()`: The `get_nfilter_request_var()` function is used to get a request variable from the URL. However, it does not validate the input and can lead to RCE attacks if an attacker can control the query string.
7. Insecure use of `eval()`: The `eval()` function is used to execute a string as PHP code. However, it should be avoided when possible because it allows for arbitrary code execution.
8. Insecure use of `str_replace()`: The `str_replace()` function is used to replace strings in the output. However, it does not validate the input and can lead to RCE attacks if an attacker can control the search or replacement string.
9. Insecure use of `mb_strlen()`: The `mb_strlen()` function is used to get the length of a string in bytes. However, it does not validate the input and can lead to RCE attacks if an attacker can control the string.
10. Insecure use of `header()`: The `header()` function is used to set HTTP headers. However, it does not validate the input and can lead to XSS attacks if an attacker can control the header name or value.

It's important to note that this code was written in 2014, so some of these vulnerabilities may have already been fixed or have known mitigations. However, it's still important to review and update legacy code to ensure it remains secure.
