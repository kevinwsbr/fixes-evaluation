 The provided code is a method `createFooterScripts` from the class `PageRegular`. This method generates footer scripts for a webpage based on various settings defined in a layout object (`$objLayout`) and page object (`$objPage`). It handles jQuery, MooTools, framework-agnostic JavaScripts, external JavaScripts, and custom JavaScripts.

Here's a brief explanation of what the code does:

1. Initializes an empty string `$strScripts` to store the generated scripts.
2. Generates jQuery scripts if enabled in the layout settings. It retrieves the templates defined for jQuery from the layout object and parses them into `$strScripts`.
3. Generates MooTools scripts if enabled in the layout settings. Similarly, it retrieves the templates defined for MooTools and parses them into `$strScripts`.
4. Adds framework-agnostic JavaScripts to `$strScripts` by retrieving and parsing the template files defined in the layout object.
5. Generates external JavaScripts by finding the file entries based on their UUIDs, checking if they exist, and adding them to `$strScripts`.
6. Adds custom JavaScripts defined in the layout object to `$strScripts`.
7. Finally, it assigns all generated scripts to the template variable `mootools` (the naming is a bit misleading as it's not only for MooTools but also includes other scripts).
