  This code defines a new class `PageRegular` that extends the existing `Page` class. The main difference is that this class now uses a new method called `createFooterScripts` to generate the JavaScript and JSON-LD scripts for the page footer.

The `createFooterScripts` method first checks if any JavaScript or JSON-LD data has been registered in the current response context (using the `responseContext` property). If there is no such registration, it returns an empty string.

Otherwise, it generates a HTML script tag for each external JavaScript file that was registered in the response context using the `Template::generateScriptTag` method. The `generateScriptTag` method takes care of generating the correct URL and attributes for the script tag.

Finally, the `createFooterScripts` method adds the custom JavaScript code from the page layout to the generated HTML script tags.

It is important to note that this class uses a new feature called "alias" which allows developers to create an alias for a class. This means that the developer can use the name `PageRegular` as an alternative to the full qualified name `Page`.

Also, the method `createFooterScripts` is not static anymore, meaning that it needs to be called on an instance of the class (like `$objPage->createFooterScripts()`).

This change allows Contao to use a different JavaScript framework than jQuery or MooTools. In fact, Contao 5 now supports both jQuery and MooTools as well as any other custom JavaScript library that developers might want to use.
