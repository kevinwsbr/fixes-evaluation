This is an HTML file that allows users to upload, download, and delete document templates. The file uses a few PHP functions, including `attr()`, which escapes special characters in strings to prevent XSS attacks, and `text()`, which displays text as plain text without interpreting any HTML tags.

The file includes two forms: one for uploading a template and another for downloading or deleting a template. The first form contains an input field for selecting a file to upload, a label to display the selected filename, and a submit button for submitting the form. The second form contains a dropdown menu of existing templates and buttons for downloading and deleting a template.

The script at the end of the file attaches a click event listener to the "Choose file" label, which displays the selected filename in the input field after a file is selected. This allows users to see the name of the file they have chosen before submitting the form.
