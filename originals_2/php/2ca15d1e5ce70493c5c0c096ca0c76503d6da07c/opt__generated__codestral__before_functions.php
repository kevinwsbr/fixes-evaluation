 This is a set of PHP functions that are used in WordPress to handle file and directory operations. Here's a brief explanation of each function:

1. `recurse_dirsize($path, $exclude = '', $max_execution_time = 0, &$directory_cache = array(), $save_cache = true)`: This function is used to recursively calculate the size of a directory. It takes into account an optional exclude pattern and maximum execution time. The function uses a cache to store previously calculated sizes for faster access in subsequent calls.

2. `invalidate_dirsize_cache($path)`: This function is used to invalidate entries within the dirsize_cache. It removes the current directory and all parent directories from the dirsize_cache transient, which can be useful if a file or directory has been modified.

3. `normalize_dirsize_cache_path($path)`: This function is used to normalize dirsize cache path. It ensures that array keys within the dirsize_cache transient follow the same format by removing the absolute path and untrailing any slashes.

4. `is_wp_version_compatible($required)`: This function checks compatibility with the current WordPress version. It takes a required minimum version as an argument and returns true if the required version is compatible or empty, false otherwise.

5. `is_php_version_compatible($required)`: This function checks compatibility with the current PHP version. It takes a required minimum version as an argument and returns true if the required version is compatible or empty, false otherwise.

6. `wp_fuzzy_number_match($expected, $actual, $precision = 1)`: This function checks if two numbers are nearly the same. It's similar to using `round()`, but the precision is more fine-grained. The function takes an expected value, an actual value, and a specified precision as arguments, and returns true if the numbers match within the specified precision, false otherwise.
