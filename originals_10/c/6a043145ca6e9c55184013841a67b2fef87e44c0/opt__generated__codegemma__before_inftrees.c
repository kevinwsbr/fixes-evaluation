**Purpose:**

The provided code snippet is a C function called `huff_table()` that creates a Huffman coding table. It takes a set of frequencies, symbols, and maximum code length as input and generates a table that maps input symbols to their corresponding Huffman codes.

**Algorithm:**

The function works by iterating over the input frequencies and symbols. For each symbol, it calculates the Huffman code based on the frequency of the symbol and the maximum code length. The code is then stored in a table along with the corresponding symbol and operation.

**Key Points:**

- The function uses a binary tree structure to represent the Huffman code tree.
- The table is filled in using a recursive algorithm that iterates over the tree and assigns codes to each symbol.
- The code length is determined by the depth of the path from the root node to the symbol node.
- The function checks for invalid code lengths and sets a special marker for invalid codes.

**Input:**

- `table`: A pointer to the starting address of the Huffman coding table.
- `work`: An array containing the frequencies of the input symbols.
- `base`: An array containing the starting value for each symbol.
- `extra`: An array containing the extra bits for each symbol.
- `count`: An array containing the number of times each code length is used.
- `lens`: An array containing the maximum code length for each symbol.
- `max`: The maximum code length allowed.
- `type`: Determines whether the table is for lengths or distances.

**Output:**

- The function fills in the Huffman coding table `*table`.
- It returns 0 if successful, and 1 if the table size exceeds the maximum allowed.

**Usage:**

The `huff_table()` function can be used to generate Huffman coding tables for various applications, such as data compression and error correction.

**Additional Notes:**

- The constants `ENOUGH_LENS` and `ENOUGH_DISTS` determine the maximum size of the Huffman coding table.
- The code assumes that the input frequencies are non-negative.
- The function does not handle invalid input or errors.
