 This is a function in C language that constructs Huffman tables for length and distance symbols in the DEFLATE algorithm, which is used in gzip, PNG and ZIP formats. The purpose of this function is to create a table that can be used for efficiently encoding or decoding length and distance symbols based on their variable-length Huffman codes.

The function takes four parameters: `table`, `bits`, `work` and `count`. `table` is a pointer to the Huffman table being constructed, `bits` is a pointer to an integer that will store the number of bits used for the root of the table, `work` is an array containing the symbol values in order of increasing frequency, and `count` is an array containing the count of each symbol length. The function returns 0 if successful, or 1 if there was not enough space to construct the table.

The main steps of this function are:

* Initialize variables for current table index bits (`curr`), current bits to drop from code for index (`drop`), low trigger value (`low`), used table entries (`used`), and mask for comparing low (`mask`).
* Check if there is enough space in the table to store all symbols.
* Process all codes and make table entries by creating a `here` structure for each symbol, which contains its bits, operation value (op) and literal or length/distance value (val).
* Replicate the entry for those indices with low len bits equal to huff.
* Backwards increment the len-bit code huff.
* Go to next symbol, update count, len.
* Create new sub-table if needed.
* Fill in remaining table entry if code is incomplete.
* Set return parameters.
