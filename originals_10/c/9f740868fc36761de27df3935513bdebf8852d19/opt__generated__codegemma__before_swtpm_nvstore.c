**Purpose:**

The provided code snippet is a set of functions that handle the encryption and decryption of data in a Secure World TPM (SWTPM) Non-Volatile RAM (NVRAM) environment. The functions provide functionalities for:

- Decrypting migration data
- Encrypting data
- Printing JSON output of NVRAM state

**Key Functions:**

- `swtpm_nvram_decrypt_migration_data()`: Decrypts migration data using the migration key.
- `swtpm_nvram_encrypt_data()`: Encrypts data using the state encryption key.
- `swtpm_nvram_print_json()`: Prints JSON output of NVRAM state.

**Encryption and Decryption:**

- The `swtpm_nvram_decrypt_migration_data()` function decrypts migration data using the migration key.
- If the migration data is still encrypted with the state encryption key, it decrypts it using that key.
- The `swtpm_nvram_encrypt_data()` function encrypts data using the state encryption key.

**JSON Output:**

- The `swtpm_nvram_print_json()` function generates JSON output that includes information about the available NVRAM states, such as their names and sizes.

**Usage:**

- The `swtpm_nvram_decrypt_migration_data()` function can be used to decrypt migration data.
- The `swtpm_nvram_encrypt_data()` function can be used to encrypt data.
- The `swtpm_nvram_print_json()` function can be used to display NVRAM state information in JSON format.

**Additional Notes:**

- The code uses the `swtpm` library for interacting with the TPM.
- The `tpmstate` library provides utility functions for accessing TPM state.
- The `g_nvram_backend_ops` variable is assumed to be initialized elsewhere in the code.
