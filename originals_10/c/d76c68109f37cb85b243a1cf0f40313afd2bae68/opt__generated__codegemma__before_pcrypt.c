**Module Name:** pcrypt

**Description:**

The pcrypt module is a parallel crypto wrapper that provides efficient and secure encryption and decryption operations. It uses a workqueue to distribute encryption and decryption tasks across multiple CPUs.

**Key Features:**

* Parallel encryption and decryption
* Flexible configuration options
* Support for multiple CPU cores
* Robust error handling

**API:**

The pcrypt module provides a set of functions for creating and using parallel crypto objects:

* `start_ata_pcrypt`: Initializes a parallel crypto object.
* `fini_padata`: Frees the resources used by a parallel crypto object.

**Usage:**

To use the pcrypt module, you can create a parallel crypto object using the `start_ata_pcrypt()` function. The function takes two arguments:

* `pcrypt`: A pointer to a parallel crypto object.
* `name`: A name for the parallel crypto object.

Once you have created a parallel crypto object, you can use it to encrypt and decrypt data using the following functions:

* `padata_encrypt`: Encrypts data using the parallel crypto object.
* `padata_decrypt`: Decrypts data using the parallel crypto object.

**Benefits:**

* Improved performance for large amounts of data
* Enhanced security through parallel processing
* Flexibility in configuration and use

**Limitations:**

* Requires multiple CPU cores to be available.
* May have a higher memory footprint than traditional crypto implementations.

**Code Structure:**

The pcrypt module is implemented as a kernel module with the following components:

* Workqueue for distributing encryption and decryption tasks.
* Padata object for managing encryption and decryption operations.
* Crypto template for registering the pcrypt module with the kernel crypto framework.

**Module Initialization and Exit:**

The module is initialized during the kernel boot process and exited when the system is shutdown.
