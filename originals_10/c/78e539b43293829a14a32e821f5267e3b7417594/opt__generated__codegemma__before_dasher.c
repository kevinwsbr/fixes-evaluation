**Purpose:**

The provided text describes a video streaming technology called DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) and its usage with the gpac tool. It outlines the requirements for a multiplexer development that supports segmented output for DASH streams.

**Key Points:**

**DASH Segmentation:**

- DASH segments are identified by the `FileNumber` property in packet properties.
- The `EODS` property signals the end of a DASH segment.
- The `dasher` tool generates cues and roll keys for segmenting.

**Multiplexer Considerations:**

- The multiplexer must be able to inspect packet properties.
- It must send downstream events to indicate the size of segments and indexes.
- It must support filter options such as `noinit`, `frag`, and `sub_sidx`.
- It must set properties on output PIDs to indicate DASH mode, duration, and LLHLS usage.

**Segmenter Properties:**

- The segmenter adds properties to output PIDs to identify DASH mode, duration, and LLHLS usage.

**Usage:**

The text provides examples of how the `dasher` tool can be used to generate DASH streams with segmented outputs.

**Conclusion:**

The provided text describes the requirements for a multiplexer that supports segmented output for DASH streams. This information is essential for developers who want to create tools that integrate with DASH technology.

**Additional Notes:**

- The text uses technical jargon specific to video streaming and gpac.
- The code snippets provide examples of how the `dasher` tool can be used.
- The private size of the `GF_DasherCtx` structure is specified.
