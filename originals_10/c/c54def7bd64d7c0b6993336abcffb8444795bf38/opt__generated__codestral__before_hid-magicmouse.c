 This is the source code for a Linux kernel driver for Apple's Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad. The driver is written in C and uses the HID (Human Interface Device) subsystem provided by the Linux kernel.

Here are some key aspects of the code:

1. It defines a `hid_device_id` array `magic_mice`, which contains the USB vendor ID and product ID for Apple's Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad. This is used to match the devices that this driver supports.
2. The `probe` function is called when the kernel detects a new device that matches one of the entries in the `magic_mice` array. It allocates memory for a `struct magicmouse_sc`, initializes some fields, parses the HID report descriptor, and starts the HID hardware.
3. The driver registers an input mapping using the `input_mapping` callback function. This defines how the raw data from the device is mapped to input events (such as mouse movements or button presses) that can be handled by user-space applications.
4. The `raw_event` callback function is called when a new report is received from the device. It processes the data and generates input events using `input_report_key`, `input_sync`, and other functions provided by the Linux kernel's input subsystem.
5. Finally, the driver is registered with the Linux kernel using `module_hid_driver`. This makes it available for use as a loadable module.
