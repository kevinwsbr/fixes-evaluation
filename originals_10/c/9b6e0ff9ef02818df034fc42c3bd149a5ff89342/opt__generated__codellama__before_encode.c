 This is a C function that takes in a `struct dwg_ent *` object and a `struct data *` object as input, and writes the xdata associated with the object to the output buffer. The function uses the `rbuf` structure to store the information about each group code in the xdata block, and it iterates over the rbuf list to write the appropriate values to the output buffer.

The function first checks whether the `xdata_size` field of the object is equal to the number of bytes actually written to the buffer. If they are not equal, the function prints a warning message. This check is necessary because some DWG files have incorrect xdata sizes that can cause problems during decoding.

The function then iterates over the rbuf list, and for each group code in the xdata block it checks whether there is enough space in the output buffer to write the corresponding value. If there is not enough space, the function breaks out of the loop and returns an error code.

For each group code that has enough space in the output buffer, the function calls a series of functions `bit_write_RD`, `bit_write_RL`, `bit_write_RLL`, `bit_write_RC`, `bit_write_TF` to write the appropriate value. The functions are responsible for writing the actual values in the correct format, and they also print a message to the log file indicating what value was written.

The function then writes the current position of the output buffer (`dat->byte`) to the object's `xdata_size` field, and returns an error code if there were any errors during the writing process.
