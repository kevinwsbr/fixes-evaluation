 This is a PHP class definition for an AuditEntry model. The AuditEntry class is used to manage audit logs in the system. Here's a brief explanation of what some parts of the code do:

1. **Properties**: The class has properties like `id`, `object_type`, `object_id`, `event_id`, `staff_id`, `user_id`, `data`, `ip`, and `timestamp`. These are used to store information about each audit log entry.

2. **Constructor Method**: This method initializes a new instance of the AuditEntry class with the provided variables. If no variables are provided, it will create an empty object.

3. **Audit Methods**: The `audit` and `auditEvent` methods are used to log audit events in the system. The `audit` method takes several parameters, including the event name, the data associated with the event, and additional information about the event. It then determines which type of object the event is related to (ticket, task, or user) and calls the appropriate method to handle the logging.

4. **Create Method**: The `create` method creates a new audit log entry with the provided variables. It sets the timestamp for the entry to the current time using SQL's NOW() function.

5. **AutoCreateTable Method**: This static method is used to create the audit table in the database if it doesn't already exist. If the table does not exist, it will also add necessary events ('login', 'logout', 'message', 'note') to the event table of the system.
