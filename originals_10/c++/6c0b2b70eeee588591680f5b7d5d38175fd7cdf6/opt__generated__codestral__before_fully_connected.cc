 This is a C++ source code file for the TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) library. The code provides implementations of various functions to perform fully connected (dense) operations on tensors in a neural network. It supports multiple kernel types and data formats, including floating-point numbers, quantized integers, and shuffled quantized integers.

   Here's an overview of the main components and functionalities:

   1. Namespaces and Includes: The code is organized within several nested namespaces (`tflite`, `ops`, and `builtin`) to group related functions and classes. It includes necessary header files from TensorFlow Lite for operations, types, tensor utilities, and error handling.

   2. Anonymous Namespace for Kernel Type Enumeration: The code defines an anonymous namespace containing an enumeration (`kernel_type`) that specifies the different kernel types supported for fully connected operations. These include a reference implementation, a generic optimized version, and a legacy implementation for PIE clients.

   3. Fully Connected Namespace: The main functionality is encapsulated within the `fully_connected` namespace. This includes functions for initialization, freeing memory, preparing input/output tensors, and performing the actual fully connected operation.

   4. Initialization (Init) and Free Functions: These functions are called during the lifetime of a TFLite model to allocate or release resources required by the fully connected operation. In this case, they do not perform any specific actions and return immediately.

   5. Prepare Function Template: The `Prepare` function is a template that takes a kernel type as a parameter and performs necessary preparations for executing a fully connected operation using the specified kernel type. It initializes context data, sets input/output tensors' data types, allocates temporary storage for shuffled inputs (if required), and validates the parameters and dimensions of input tensors against output tensors.

   6. Evaluation Function Template: The `Eval` function is another template that takes a kernel type as a parameter. It performs the actual fully connected operation using the specified kernel type. Depending on the data type of the filter tensor, it calls different evaluation functions (e.g., `EvalFloat`, `EvalQuantized`, or `EvalShuffledQuantized`) to handle floating-point numbers, quantized integers, and shuffled quantized integers, respectively.

   7. Evaluation Functions: The evaluation functions (`EvalFloat`, `EvalQuantized`, and `EvalShuffledQuantized`) are responsible for performing the matrix multiplication between input and filter tensors, adding bias (if provided), and applying activation functions to obtain output tensors. These functions are specialized based on the kernel type and data types of the input and filter tensors.

   8. Registration Functions: The code provides several registration functions that return a `TfLiteRegistration` object for registering fully connected operations in TFLite. Each registration function is associated with a specific kernel type (e.g., reference, generic optimized, or legacy PIE).
