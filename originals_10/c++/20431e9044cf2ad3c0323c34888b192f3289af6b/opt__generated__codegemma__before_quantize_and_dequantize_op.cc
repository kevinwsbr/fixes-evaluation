## Analysis of TensorFlow Quantization Kernels

This code snippet registers kernel builders for various TensorFlow quantization operations. Let's break down each section:

**CPU Kernels:**

* The `REGISTER_CPU_KERNEL` macro registers builders for `QuantizeAndDequantizeV2`, `QuantizeAndDequantizeV3`, `QuantizeAndDequantizeV4`, and `QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad` operations with various data types (float and double).
* These kernels implement different quantization and dequantization algorithms.

**GPU Kernels:**

* The `REGISTER_GPU_KERNEL` macro registers builders for the same operations as the CPU kernels, but for GPU devices.
* These kernels leverage GPU-specific optimizations for accelerated calculations.

**Functors:**

* The code includes definitions for `QuantizeAndDequantizeOneScaleGradientFunctor` and `QuantizeAndDequantizePerChannelGradientFunctor`, which are used in the kernel implementations.
* These functors handle the gradient calculations during the quantization and dequantization process.

**Usage:**

These kernel builders are used when TensorFlow encounters operations requiring quantization and dequantization. The specific kernel selected depends on the device (CPU or GPU), data type, and operation type.

**Overall, this code demonstrates how TensorFlow integrates various kernel builders for different quantization and dequantization operations, enabling efficient calculations on both CPU and GPU devices.**
