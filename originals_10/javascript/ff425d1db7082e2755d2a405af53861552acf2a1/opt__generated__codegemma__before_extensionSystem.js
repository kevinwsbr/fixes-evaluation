**Function Summary**

The code snippet you provided is a JavaScript module that provides functions for enabling, disabling, and managing extensions in a system.

**Key Functions:**

* `enableExtension(uuid)`: Enables an extension with the given UUID.
* `disableExtension(uuid)`: Disables an extension with the given UUID.
* `getEnabledExtensions()`: Returns a list of enabled extensions.
* `onEnabledExtensionsChanged()`: Handles changes to the enabled extensions setting.
* `_loadExtensions()`: Loads and initializes extensions.
* `enableAllExtensions()`: Enables all extensions.
* `disableAllExtensions()`: Disables all extensions.
* `_sessionUpdated()`: Updates the enabled extensions based on the session mode.
* `init()`: Initializes the extension management system.

**Purpose**

The module's purpose is to provide a mechanism for enabling and disabling extensions, as well as handling events related to changes in the enabled extensions setting.

**Usage**

The `init()` function should be called to initialize the extension management system. The `enableExtension()` and `disableExtension()` functions can be used to control individual extensions.

**Session Mode Impact**

The session mode determines whether extensions are enabled or disabled. The `_sessionUpdated()` function handles this aspect based on the `allowExtensions` property of the session mode.

**Key Variables**

* `enabledExtensions`: A list of enabled extensions.
* `initted`: A flag indicating whether extensions have been initialized.
* `enabled`: A flag indicating whether extensions are currently enabled.

**Additional Notes:**

* The `ExtensionUtils` object is assumed to provide functionality for managing extensions, such as finding extensions and installing them.
* The `global.settings` object is assumed to provide access to application settings.
* The `Main.sessionMode` object is assumed to provide information about the current session mode.
* The `_signals` object is assumed to provide a mechanism for emitting events.
