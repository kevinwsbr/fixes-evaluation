This is a JavaScript file that contains the implementation of an extension manager for the GNOME Shell environment. The code defines a number of functions and variables related to managing extensions, including loading and enabling them, handling preferences, and updating the session mode.

The main entry point of this module is the `init` function, which sets up event handlers and initializes the extension manager by calling `_sessionUpdated`. This function connects to the `updated` signal of the `Main.sessionMode` object, which represents the current session mode in GNOME Shell. The `updated` signal is emitted whenever the session mode changes (e.g., when the user logs in or out).

The `_sessionUpdated` function is called whenever the `updated` signal is emitted, and it initializes the extension manager by calling `_loadExtensions`, which loads all available extensions and sets up event handlers for managing enabled extensions. It also enables all extensions that are allowed by the session mode (either from the `enabled-extensions` preference or from the `Main.sessionMode.enabledExtensions` property).

The `enableAllExtensions` function enables all extensions that are currently allowed by the session mode. This function is called when the user logs in, and it enables all extensions that have been previously enabled.

The `disableAllExtensions` function disables all extensions that are currently enabled. This function is called when the user logs out.

The `_onVersionValidationChanged` function is called whenever the `EXTENSION_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK_KEY` preference changes, and it reloads all extensions to update their version validation state.

The `loadExtension` function loads an individual extension by calling its `init` function and setting up event handlers for managing its state. It also enables the extension if it is allowed by the session mode.

The `getEnabledExtensions` function returns a list of all enabled extensions, including those that have been previously enabled. This function is used to initialize the `enabledExtensions` variable in `_loadExtensions`.

The `onEnabledExtensionsChanged` function is called whenever the `ENABLED_EXTENSIONS_KEY` preference changes, and it enables or disables any newly added or removed extensions based on their UUIDs. It also updates the `enabledExtensions` variable to reflect the new list of enabled extensions.

The `enableExtension` function enables an individual extension by setting its `state` property to `ExtensionState.ENABLED`. This function is called whenever a new extension is added or an existing extension is enabled.

The `disableExtension` function disables an individual extension by setting its `state` property to `ExtensionState.DISABLED`. This function is called whenever an existing extension is disabled or removed.
