 This C code is a part of the implementation of a "file" command which determines the type of a given file. The function `print_sep` is responsible for printing a separator between multiple matches when displaying the results, while the function `handle_annotation` deals with handling annotations such as MIME types and Apple file types based on flags set in the magic_set structure.

   In the context of this provided code snippet:

   1. The `print_sep` function checks if the `MAGIC_MIME` flag is set in the magic_set structure, which might indicate that we are dealing with a MIME type and no separator is needed for formatting purposes. If it's not set and this is not the first line of output, it prints a newline character followed by a dash to separate multiple matches in the display.

   2. The `handle_annotation` function checks if the `MAGIC_APPLE` flag is set in the magic_set structure and, if so, writes the Apple file type annotation (a 8-character string) to the output using the `file_printf` function. If the `MAGIC_MIME_TYPE` flag is set, it writes the MIME type annotation to the output instead.

   Note that error handling is performed within these functions in case of any failures during writing to the output. The code assumes the existence of other structures and functions such as `file_printf`, `struct magic_set`, and `struct magic`.
