 
This is the source code for the `cdc-ncm` USB driver. It defines a `struct usb_driver` named `cdc_ncm_driver` that contains information about the driver and a table of device IDs it supports. The driver also includes some customization options, such as support for arp handling.

The source code is written in C programming language and uses Linux kernel APIs to interact with the USB subsystem. It defines several functions that are used by the driver: `usbnet_probe`, `usbnet_disconnect`, `usbnet_suspend`, `usbnet_resume` and `supports_autosuspend`. These functions are responsible for handling different events in the driver's life cycle, such as device connection, disconnection, suspension and resumption.

The source code also defines a table of devices that the driver supports using the `cdc_devs` variable. This table includes information about the devices such as vendor ID, product ID, class, subclass and protocol, as well as customization options for each device. The last entry in the table is an empty structure which is used to terminate the list of supported devices.

Overall, this code defines a USB driver that can be loaded by the Linux kernel to manage CDC NCM devices.
