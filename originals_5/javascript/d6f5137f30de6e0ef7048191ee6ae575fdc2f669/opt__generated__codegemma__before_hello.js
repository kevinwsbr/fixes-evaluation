**Response:**

The code you provided includes several functions and enhancements for working with data in a web application. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

**Data Conversion:**

- `utils.dataToJSON()` function converts a `FormElement`, `NodeList`, `InputElement`, or any other data object to JSON format.
- It handles different data types such as form elements, files, and blobs.
- It recursively converts nested objects and arrays to JSON.

**Blob Creation:**

- `utils.binaryToBlob()` function converts a binary string to a Blob object.
- It extracts the MIME type from the string and creates a new Blob object with the corresponding data.

**Response Handling:**

- `hello.utils.responseHandler()` function handles responses solicited through an iframe hash tag following an API request.
- It saves any access token found in the current page URL.

**Additional Enhancements:**

- The code includes wrappers to extend existing functions with additional functionality.
- It provides utilities for working with form data, file objects, and JSON data.

**Usage:**

- The `utils.dataToJSON()` function can be used to convert form data to JSON format before sending it to an API.
- The `utils.binaryToBlob()` function can be used to convert binary data to Blob objects.
- The `hello.utils.responseHandler()` function should be included in the code to handle API responses.

**Conclusion:**

The code provides a set of useful functions and enhancements for working with data in a web application. It simplifies the process of converting different data types to JSON format, creating Blob objects, and handling API responses.
