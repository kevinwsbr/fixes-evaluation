 The given list of numbers is a subset of the Fibonacci sequence. In fact, it is the first 50 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting from 0 and 1.

Here are the first 50 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2596, 4181, 6765, 10946, 17711, 28657, 46368, 75025, 121393, 196418, 317811, 514229, 832040, 1346269, 2178309, 3524578, 5702887, 9227465, 14930352, 24157817, 39088169, 63245986, 102334155, 165580141, 267914296, 433494437, 701408733, 1134903170, 1836311903

These numbers can be generated using the following formula: Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2, where F0 = 0 and F1 = 1.
