This is the implementation of the `Link` class in Pimcore. It provides a way to store and manipulate links in the website content. The class has a number of methods that allow you to interact with the link, such as setting its href, getting its href, determining if it is empty, etc.

The class also implements the `DependencyResolver` interface, which allows Pimcore to automatically resolve dependencies between objects in the website content. This means that when a link is added or modified, Pimcore will check if it references any other objects in the website (such as documents, assets, or other links) and create an entry for those objects in the dependency list.

The `rewriteIds` method is used to rewrite the IDs of objects referenced by this link when the object ID mapping is updated. This method allows Pimcore to automatically update the link when the object is renamed, moved, or deleted.
