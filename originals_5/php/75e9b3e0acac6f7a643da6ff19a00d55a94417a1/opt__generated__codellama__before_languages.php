The code generates a table of all the available languages and their properties, including the original name, English name, LMS folder, and properties. The table has four columns:

1. An empty column used for bulk actions (checkboxes).
2. The original name of the language.
3. The English name of the language.
4. The LMS folder associated with the language.
5. A set of properties that are specific to the language, such as whether it is available or not, and whether it is the default language.

The table also includes links to edit the language, make it available or unavailable, and add a sub-language for the language. The user can also delete the sub-language if there is no term associated with it.

The `SortableTableFromArrayConfig` class is used to create a sortable table from an array of data. The constructor takes three parameters: the data array, the number of columns in the table (1 in this case), and the number of rows in the table (the total number of languages).

The `set_header()` method sets the header for each column in the table. In this case, we set an empty column as the first column, and the original name, English name, LMS folder, and properties as the other columns.

The `set_form_actions()` method sets the form actions that can be performed on the data in the table. In this case, we set two form actions: make available and make unavailable.

Finally, we display the footer and the table using the `display()` method of the `SortableTableFromArrayConfig` class.
