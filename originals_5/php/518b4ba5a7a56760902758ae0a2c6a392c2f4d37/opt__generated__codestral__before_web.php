 * Here is an explanation of what each route does in this code:

1. The first group of routes are for the dashboard, where users can view transactions, accounts, budgets, and reports. These routes require authentication and authorization middleware to ensure that only authorized users can access these pages.
2. The second group of routes are for the transaction management functionality, which allows users to create, edit, delete, and view transactions, as well as import transactions from a CSV file or bank feeds. These routes also require authentication and authorization middleware.
3. The third group of routes are for the account management functionality, which allows users to create, edit, delete, and view accounts, as well as transfer funds between accounts. These routes require authentication and authorization middleware.
4. The fourth group of routes are for the budget management functionality, which allows users to create, edit, delete, and view budgets, as well as set limits on their spending in each category. These routes also require authentication and authorization middleware.
5. The fifth group of routes are for the report management functionality, which allows users to generate reports on their financial data based on various criteria such as date range, account type, category, or tag. These routes require authentication and authorization middleware.
6. The sixth group of routes are for the link management functionality, which allows users to create links between transactions in Firefly III and external applications such as a bank website or a payment processor. These routes also require authentication and authorization middleware.
7. The seventh group of routes are for the popup functionality, which allows users to view additional information about their financial data without leaving the current page. These routes require authentication and authorization middleware.
8. The eighth group of routes are for the webhook management functionality, which allows users to configure webhooks that can be triggered by various events in Firefly III such as a new transaction or an updated budget limit. These routes also require authentication and authorization middleware.
9. The final group of routes are for the admin functionality, which allows the administrator of the Firefly III instance to manage users, update settings, check for updates, and perform other administrative tasks. These routes require authentication and authorization middleware as well as the 'admin' role.
